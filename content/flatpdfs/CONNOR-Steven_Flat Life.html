<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">The Shape of Thought</font></p>
</b> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This paper concerns skin 
  and its participation in the subtle, secret life of substance. It is about paper, 
  cards, gambling and masturbation. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And about the shape of thought. 
  What shape is thought? A bubble? A breast-like container, as Wilfred Bion (1967) 
  thought? An immaterial Cartesian point? Or perhaps, as Didier Anzieu suspects 
  (1979), some kind of tegument? A tangled lattice of synapses? Why think about 
  thinking in terms of shape? Perhaps because we find it almost impossible to 
  think, and more especially to think of thinking, without thinking of shape. 
  My interest is in the relationship between the thought of shape and the shape 
  of thought. In thinking of shape, any shape, one assimilates that shape, assimilates 
  one’s thinking to it. Which contains which? Does the thinking enfold the shape, 
  or the shape mould and cradle the thought of the shape? In what space might 
  this mutual embrace of the shape of thinking and the thought of shape occur, 
  or, what shape could the mutual shaping of thought and shape have? How is the 
  concept of shape grasped, how does the hand think?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What if there were two worlds, 
  divided not along the line of the extended and the unextended, that which has 
  dimension and that which does not, but the flat and the full? The flat world 
  is the world of surfaces, the full world is the world of shapes in space. The 
  full world would have interiority as well as volume: it would be full of latency, 
  of hidden, implicit, reserved things. The flat world would have no interiority, 
  no depth, no secret, nothing hidden from view. Whatever was not seen in it would 
  simply be not to be seen, rather than something withdrawn from sight. The full 
  world, by contrast, would allow communication, action at a distance, and the 
  resonance of hidden things one with another. It would be a world of sounds and 
  radiations, as imaged in Marcel Duchamp’s <i>Bruit caché</i>, a sealed 
  box with an unidentifiable noise in it. The flat world would be characterised 
  not by communication but by contact. Where a world of volumes enjoins attention 
  to the relations between inside and outside, the flat imaginary is drawn to 
  inversion and mirroring, the alternations of recto and verso, front and back. 
  Lewis Carroll’s eminently flat imagination is perfectly imaged as a mirror-writing: 
  in which passing through the mirror into the Looking-Glass world is equivalent 
  simply to writing backwards, or right to left. Looking-Glass land is therefore 
  much more than a reversed image of our world. For in it, things move backwards 
  and forwards with equal facility: ‘Do cats eat bats? Do bats eat cats? ... ‘Important 
  ... Unimportant ... Important ... Unimportant’ (Carroll 1976: 28, 155). It is 
  not so much an upside down, as a palindromic world, a world in which direction 
  is indifferent. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Edwin A. Abbot’s <i>Flatland</i> 
  (1991) offered us the idea of a world restricted to two dimensions as a fable. 
  This flat world is no mere phantasm. It lives and spreads, more and more emphatically, 
  in our world. The iMac, the Pompidou Centre of computer design, with its counterfeit 
  transparency opening on to that faux-anatomy, is a response to the radical flattening 
  and thinning of computer screens, which display the fact that there are no workings 
  going on behind or underneath them. In a network, there is only the lateral 
  slide or knight’s move sideways to another site, another page, another screen, 
  which is the same screen.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In what we call modernity, 
  such flatness has always, so to speak, bulked large. The flat world is all-apparent. 
  It is that world which ‘clung together by its edges’ of which William James 
  speaks (1996: 86). It is the world of the map and the grid and the network; 
  but, above all, it is the paper world that has been for so long our own and 
  that now dreams of its passing away. Modernity is sometimes dated by the advent 
  of perspective, the arrival of depth. dimension, and with them historicity, 
  into a world of mere surfaces. We think of the modern world as coming into being 
  with the scooping out of the subject in its absent fullness, with the intuition 
  that there is more to things, and to ourselves, than meets the eye. But the 
  modern world is a world that depends upon a flat apprehension; and perspective 
  itself is a technique, not exactly for rendering flat things deep, but for reducing 
  volumes and depths and distances to flat schemata. Flatness makes possible that 
  dream of universal tabulation on a single plane which is evidenced in the introduction 
  to the <i>Encyclopédie</i>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Scrolling </font></p>
</b> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The scroll is the ideal 
  form of the book. A scroll is not divided into pages of a certain fixed length, 
  but simply continues until it comes to an end. The form of the scroll has reappeared 
  in the serial composition allowed by the word-processor, but the idea of the 
  scroll has lived on in the book through seven hundred years. The turning of 
  the pages of a book, the regular alternation of recto and verso, the steady 
  skimming of the pages on the right, and their drifting together on the left, 
  seem to offer to reading a certain kind of body-image, in a building, or the 
  concretion of a structure through time. As the plot thickens, so does this body-image. 
  We deprecate the skim-reader, and admire the one who devours books, who takes 
  books into their substance. The inward digestion of books, and the alimentary 
  passage of books through an imaginary body is to be seen in Leopold Bloom gently 
  and wisely assisting the passage of his stool with a bit of light reading. The 
  merging of horizons through which Georges Poulet imagines the act of reading 
  (not the body of the reader, but the body of the reading) is an elaborated version 
  of this three-dimensional reading body. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But there is another body 
  image for the experience of reading, which is the experience of the reading 
  as a continuous surface, a firmament which slides beneath us, and across which 
  we are moved, unbroken as long as the reading continues. This reading-body comes 
  about through the taking in to oneself as an image of the process of reading 
  of the actual or imaginary surface on which the words are inscribed. ‘Taking 
  in to oneself’: can this be quite right? No, for what one takes in remains a 
  surface, an exterior support, something on which reading, thinking the thoughts 
  of others, thinking <i>with</i> the thoughts of others, may rest. Reading is 
  a skin or scroll of thought. Contemporary critics from Barthes to Deleuze have 
  emphasised this sense of sliding or movement across a surface involved in reading. 
  Other, more traditional and intuitive ways of thinking about reading have emphasised 
  instead the alternative world, or space opened up by reading, conceived as a 
  depth or volume to which one gets access by penetrating or filling out what 
  is presented on the page. My effort at this point is to emphasise the literality 
  of the reading process or the ‘scene of reading’, the way in which reading not 
  only takes off from the page, but also takes in to itself, as its own body-image, 
  the flatness of the page or the reading surface. The phrase ‘body-image’ is 
  often taken in the sense of an image for the body, a way of imagining the body. 
  It can also be taken, and often is here taken, to mean an imaging of things 
  in terms of the body or its sensations (thus the word image is not restricted 
  to the visual, but is more generally figurative): here, the skin, in its flatness, 
  as an image for the workings of mind.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Seen in this way, the page 
  of the scroll is not so much superseded by the screen as consummated by it. 
  Rather than the three-dimensional space which might easily have been devised 
  for computer operating systems, nearly all such operating systems centre on 
  a screen display having the form of a flat surface, or desk-top. The experience 
  of lateral movement, or surfing, reduplicates or extends this body-image of 
  thought spread across, and itself taking form in a flat skin or screen. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Depictions of the act of 
  reading tend to locate it in elaborately scooped out spaces of enclosure, as 
  in the marvellously cosy quarterdeck study devised for St. Jerome in Messina’s 
  picture of him. But all this perspective, this rich and absorbing tilting and 
  intersection of planes, seems to be interpreted by the book open right at the 
  middle of the painting, as a kind of pleating or crumpling up of some more ideal 
  plane of reading in conditions of unvarying illumination. The picture shows 
  its concealment from us of the higher, less variegated illumination offered 
  by the book. Similarly, other fifteenth and sixteenth century representations 
  of the act of reading and writing emphasise the brokenness or dispersal of the 
  text across the spaces of the picture, but in order to hint at some higher uniformity, 
  in which all the books on the bookwheel, or arrayed around the scholar at the 
  desk, would have been brought into conformity with each other, brought into 
  a single plane. The ideal is not books inside other books, books folded together 
  into a concentrated mass, but books joined to each other in and endless unrolling 
  scroll. The belt process of newspaper printing ushers in the return of the scroll 
  of the internet page.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of course, the surface of 
  a page, or a playing card, or a screen, is not a skin, which, as Anzieu has 
  shown, is so brimming and rich with meaning and affect. There is nothing, as 
  Valéry said, that is deeper than the skin. The dream of flatness is always 
  asymptotic, always a sign of some flatter, more perfect flatness. Such flatness 
  is an abstracted form of one dimension of the skin: it is the skin anatomised, 
  the skin imagined along the lines, in the plane of, a mere skin, with no depth, 
  only spread.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here, then, is one part 
  of my proposition. Reading, as one form of thinking, can take from and give 
  to the page, the primal form of a flatness, a continuous contact.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b> 
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Flatlands</font></p>
</b> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Flatness appears to be lifeless, 
  because it makes us think of the breathless body, desiccated by death. Gregor 
  Samsa becomes, first an insect, who experiences the world only in two dimensions, 
  as surfaces to be crawled over, and then, after his death, an emptied-out skin: 
  ‘Gregor’s body was completely flat and dry’ (Kafka 1971: 60). But there are 
  lively, tensed forms of flatness that have much life in them. Flatness can be 
  stretched, into receptive, longing, poignant surface; the canvas, the blank 
  page, the streaming pennant. Clement Greenberg argued influentially that flatness 
  was the distinguishing condition of pictorial representation and that, as such, 
  it should be the ideal form with which painting ought to strive to coincide. 
  But flatness is not itself merely an abstract condition, not merely the absence 
  of depth, volume, dimension. Flatness bulges with meaning and value; it is, 
  as we so bizarrely say, full of itself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Flatness is affectless: 
  flatness belongs with depression and the dissociation of autism and schizophrenia. 
  But the flatness of the autistic or schizophrenic world may also be hotly impassioned, 
  however that passion may hide itself, and hide from itself. Its flatness must 
  be built and maintained, like the spider’s web or Persephone’s business. Flatness 
  is implicated in certain kinds of representation the purpose of which is to 
  heighten or sustain feeling: the flatness of certain kinds of religious representation 
  - icons, for conspicuous example - helps to give them intensity or power; and 
  the flatness of pornographic writing, its obsessiveness and circularity, and 
  especially its transformation of feeling into number, or quality into quantity, 
  intensity into repetition, seems to account for its simultaneous qualities of 
  pattern and intensity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> 
  and the flat world of cartoons reveal that the flat world is not just associated 
  with stillness and cleanness and delicacy, but also with violence. In cartoons, 
  the flatness of the screen, and the weightlessness of the world it displays, 
  is agitated by an intense violence, a violence that alternates between rupture 
  of bodily forms, and flattening of them: Tom the cat is run through a mangle 
  or rolled out like pastry by a road-roller. Though opposites in one sense, the 
  dismemberings and flattenings, the splinterings and spreadings, the contractions 
  and explosions, of bodies in the cartoon world are in fact continuous with each 
  other - they are both held together on the taut, unrupturable hypostasis of 
  the cartoon world, the flat laterality against which all is displayed. Ordinary 
  bodies, living vulnerably and decayingly in time, are poised unstably between 
  these two conditions: the atomised and the flattened.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Flatness is one of the most 
  powerful of the forms of idealised life attaching to the dissociated skin. The 
  skin which is peeled off a fruit or a body retains that body in a facsimile 
  of air, the cored phantom to which it continues to hold in its sagging, emptied-out 
  condition. It is only when the skin has been rolled or beaten out that it attains 
  the transcendent thinness that pertains to the flat. The thinner a surface is, 
  the more vulnerable it is in the real world to tearing and injury; but in imagination, 
  the thinnest substances are possessed of a power that augments in proportion 
  to their thinness and flatness: the most exquisite papers, gold beaten into 
  leaf, the finest, sheerest silks. The power of flatness in our life and imagination 
  derives from the fact that it is this kind of impossible, abstracted skin; the 
  lifeless, merely flat skin given an accessory life and value through being made 
  perfectly flat. Flatness is not exactly of the skin. Rather it is the skin skinned, 
  emptied of the substance of skin, leaving only idea; flatness behind. </font></p>
</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Flatness, like straightness, 
  is impossibility, unnatural absoluteness. This is why crop circles may seem 
  so full of mystery, for, like absolutely straight lines incised in the landscape, 
  they seem to invoke the hovering perspective from which alone they are visible. 
  Fineness is finish, that process which reduces the gross massiness of things 
  to perfect thinness. The long and complex history of the idea of subtlety - 
  in the hermetic and alchemical doctrine of the subtle body, for example - runs 
  closely parallel with the history of flatness. Flatness and finish have in them 
  the possibility of some even greater fineness, in the subtlety of objects that 
  have evaporated, become too thin even for gross sensory apprehension, and are 
  held together only by the thought of them. But held together; the idea of the 
  perfect, self-sustaining skin is always retained in ideas of the subtlety or 
  ideal tenuity. For tenuity, tendency, tenderness and tension all derive from 
  a Greek root teino, meaning stretched or drawn out, with a paradoxical relation 
  to words radiating out from <i>tenire</i>, which signify transformations of 
  touching or holding: content, intention, attention. The word subtle is from 
  Latin <i>sub-telis</i>, signifying either an underweb, or that which lies beneath 
  a web, and so perhaps signifies something woven with extreme fineness. The subtle 
  is on the boundary between materiality and thought: the subtle is the thought 
  of a substance too tenuous and rarefied for the actual senses, that requires 
  a subtle, or virtual body to apprehend it. Subtlety of action, or strategy, 
  or thought, involves the capacity to discriminate between layers, to thin one’s 
  thinking to the point where it can be insinuated into a reality that is already 
  finer than fine. In parodying this, Flann O’Brien memorialises it, in the explanations 
  offered by Policeman MacCrusikeen in <i>The Third Policeman</i>. of the process 
  of creating ever more rarified substances, so small, that they can hardly even 
  be thought about (O’Brien 1974: 62-5).</font></p>
<font size="3">
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Subtlety and flatness are 
  therefore related closely to miniaturisation and reduction in scale. The development 
  and application of the microscope for purposes of scientific investigation during 
  the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries opened up a vast and unsuspectedly 
  various world of swarming, invisible life, but also demanded that such a world 
  be flat and thin and translucent - which could be made visible on a glass microscope 
  slide. At such a scale, thickness and dimension scarcely seem to matter any 
  more.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Topology is a kind of abstract 
  caress of the world, even of the cosmos. Topology has gone far beyond the possibilities 
  of touch, into a world of ten dimensions and more, but it has done so in a mode 
  of reaching which preserves the thought of touch, the tactility of thought. 
  Topology is a model for a new form of thought that thinks, or thinks about its 
  thought (and it cannot help but do so, since topological thinking is always 
  thinking about its own thought, and thinking about its own thought is the form 
  its thinking must take), not as a transpiercing, or unveiling or penetration 
  or an attempt to get to the bottom of things, but as a spreading out or unfolding 
  extrapolation. It extrapolates the thinking of things into new forms, and thus 
  makes possible new forms, new topologies of thought. Cosmologists and mathematicians 
  have been giving great thought to the question of the shape of the universe 
  ever since Einstein’s special theory of relativity seemed to require some kind 
  of curvature of space. Since Alan Guth’s great Eureka moment on the night of 
  December 6, 1979, the moment at which he grasped that the early universe must 
  have been hugely inflationary, doubling its size 100 times in the space of 10<sup>-30</sup> 
  of a second, the statistically almost inconceivable possibility that the universe 
  might in fact be flat, which is to say, might extend outwards uniformly, without 
  any inwards or outwards curvature, has seemed more and more likely. The relative 
  uniformity of the cosmic microwave background, the record, at the limit of our 
  observations, or ‘cosmic event horizon’, around 14 billion light years away, 
  of the state of the universe at about 300,000 years old, seems to have been 
  confirmed by observations conducted only in the last couple of years. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thinking about the cosmos 
  is only the most recent form of the exchange of skins in which thinking about 
  space takes place. Topology, a science that for many years had taken place entirely 
  in the mind, or the self-embodying form which the mind employs to think about 
  such things, has met up with the world through the medium of mathematics. Topology 
  delights in enactive analogies between the skin of thought and the skin of things. 
  Here the old cliché about theoretical physics either being done with 
  a pencil on the back of an envelope or in particle accelerators the size of 
  small countries gains a new salience - or, as we had perhaps better say under 
  these circumstances, spread. Alan Guth remarks on the hermetic mirroring of 
  microcosm and macroscosm imaged in the mathematician’s relationship to the paper 
  on which his thinking is done: </font></p>
<dir> 
  <dir> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To a theoretical physicist, 
      there is no greater joy than to see that this curious activity we call calculation 
      - the depositing of ink on paper, followed by throwing away the paper and 
      depositing new ink on more paper - can actually tell us something about 
      reality. (Guth 1997)</font></p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The power of flatness, like 
  the power of any simulacrum of absoluteness, lies in part in its vulnerability. 
  Paper has its life cycle, like everything else. Paper begins in flatness, in 
  the intensity and possibility of that which has been rendered almost immaterially 
  flat. Newspaper is a daily allegory of this process. When it is first bought, 
  or appears miraculously through a letterbox, the newspaper has the qualities 
  of flatness redoubled in the tightest of folds. Newspapers promise the pent 
  newness of the smooth and the flat. The impulse to keep the newspaper smooth 
  for as long as possible, like the impulse to keep things ironed and free from 
  creases, is a projection of this idealised body-image, this bodily image of 
  the body, into the world. But the newspaper cannot survive, and is not made 
  to. It moves from the condition of virgin flatness into the formless, excremental 
  condition of waste paper. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Table-Turning</font></p>
</b> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Games are the life of flatness. 
  Nearly all human games require flat surfaces, and take their meaning from them. 
  For the dice-player, or the player of snooker or tennis, none of the life and 
  excitement of the game could exist without this participant background of flatness. 
  Flatness, levelness and smoothness, are required in order that there should 
  be equivalent chances on all sides, and thus that the tiny variations of chance 
  can be more easily disclosed and magnified. Gerolamo Cardano’s specification 
  of the ideal conditions for playing dice in his <i>Liber de Ludo Aleae </i>makes 
  it clear how much must be taken into account to achieve this ideal equilibrium: 
  </font></p>
</font> 
<dir> 
  <dir> <font size="3">
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Set the round gaming 
      boards in the middle; if they incline toward you opponent, then the dice 
      box will incline in the opposite direction, and this is unfavorable to you. 
      Similarly, if there is a slope toward you, then the box will be out of plumb 
      in your favor; but if the dice box is not moved, then this does not matter. 
      Similarly, if the board catches the light from the side opposite to you, 
      then this is bad, since it disturbs your mind; on the other hand, it is 
      to your advantage to have the board against a dark background. Again, they 
      say it is of benefit to take up your position facing a rapidly rising moon. 
      (Cardano 1953: 191)</font></p>
    </font></dir>
</dir>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Flatness approximates the 
  idea of absolute equality, equivalence, chance spread out flat. You spread out 
  chances in a pack of cards by giving spread or flatness to the condensed mass 
  of the pack. Shuffling is like kneading, or sifting. Shuffling the pack turns 
  it into something in three dimensions, creating dynamic shapes in air. But shuffling 
  (from a Germanic root <i>skuf</i> meaning to shove), the movement of cards over 
  each other, is also laminar. One shuffles when one does not lift one’s feet 
  from the floor, not breaking the contact with the plane. This importance of 
  gliding, or maintaining contact means that while the plane is the shape of thought, 
  but also the plane of sleep, which needs uniformity and evenness. Fred Astaire’s 
  roughly percussive tap steps at the beginning of <i>High Society</i> disturb 
  Ginger Rogers sleeping below him, but his sand shuffle spreads out for her the 
  membrane of sleep. I lie on a hard, flat, mattress. On such a surface, my body 
  is able to form from itself a kind of emanation within which it can then nestle. 
  I form from myself, for myself, a pupa-persona, with a folded volume, full of 
  restful intricacy. But I cannot do this standing up, and could not do it suspended 
  in mid-air, despite the attractions of the sailor’s hammock, or even the rope 
  upon which sleepers in Orwell’s spike in <i>Down and Out in Paris and London</i> 
  would rest their weight until the morning when the rope would be cut. No, sleep 
  needs flatness, needs a ground against which to form itself. Writing of his 
  discovery of the ‘dream screen’, Bertram Lewin (1946) identifies sleep as something 
  stretched out, rather than retired or rounded, in Prospero suggests.</font></p>
<font size="3">
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A game, like a dream, always 
  begins in ideal indifference, or the assumption of it. It quickly becomes marked 
  with irreversible accidents, markings that can only be erased by further markings, 
  moving further and further away from innocence into webs of contingency, of 
  the complexity that has thickly happened upon emptiness. But many games also 
  strive towards the restoration of equivalence, the emptying of the field, the 
  clearing of the arena of play. Snooker seems to embody this principle. There 
  is little more beautiful and suggestive than the imaginary, multicoloured cosmology 
  disposed in its cardinal points between the balls in their starting configurations. 
  But what is required is that everything except the cue ball should become absent, 
  leaving only the immaculacy of the green baize. You never need to clear away 
  after a game of snooker, because the game consists of the clearing away of the 
  game. Snooker is very largely an auditory spectacle, consisting of the clicks 
  and knocks of the colliding balls, the soft rumbles and judders against the 
  cushioned sides, along with fainter, more fugitive sounds, like the rasping 
  of the chalk on the head of the cue. The aim displayed and urged in snooker 
  is untouchability, with all this decorum and grace, and the white gloves of 
  the referee. The aim is to leave the table looking brand new, gradually disclosing 
  the surface on which it transpires. Snooker enacts the longing to restore smoothness, 
  which Sartre has so convincingly analysed as the sign of a world that can remain 
  inviolate, even after my appropriation of it. Snooker thus resembles the activity 
  of skiing or swimming, as evoked by Sartre, an activity that cleaves through 
  a substance, which then reforms itself in my wake, a passage which removes all 
  trace of itself. In snooker, more than any other game, the body must accommodate 
  itself to this flatness, as the stooping, crouching and stretching postures 
  enact the necessity and desire of assimilation to the flat, the opposite of 
  return to the coiled inclension of the beginnings of life. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Assimilation rather than 
  absorption; simulation rather than transformation; extension rather than interiority. 
  These are the two worlds evoked by Gilles Deleuze, who finds that Artaud and 
  Carroll write on opposite sides of a fold, establishing what he calls the logic 
  of sense (Deleuze 1990: 82-93). On one side, there is the mute world of bodies 
  in their meetings and collisions and comminglings; this is the side inhabited 
  by Artaud, the logic of sense, in the sense of the sensory. On the other side, 
  there is the world of propositions, events and consequences: the logic of sense, 
  in the sense of the word ‘sense’. One place of meeting for these two worlds 
  or series is the mouth, which is where both eating and speaking take place, 
  and so the site also of their possible commutation or confusion. As mathematician 
  Charles Dodgson energetically defended the plane trigonometry of Euclid against 
  the non-Euclidean geometry being developed in Germany during the 1860s by Bernhard 
  Riemann and Hermann von Helmholtz (Richards 1988). But his writing also shows 
  uneasiness about the relations between the plane and the solid, especially as 
  they come together at table, or in tables, as, for example, when he introduced

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The logic of both <i>Alice</i> 
  books is the logic of surfaces: the flat surface of the playing card in <i>Wonderland</i> 
  and the checkerboard in <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>. Of course, there is 
  energetic movement in another dimension too; there is perpendicularity, growth 
  and shrinkage, upwards and downwards, as well as flatness. But the book provides 
  an image of this perpendicularity in the White Rabbit’s fan, which is the corrugation 
  or articulation of a surface, which never breaks the logic of that surface. 
  (Perhaps the fan recurs in the irritatingly rumpled croquet-ground on which 
  Alice must play.) The high and the low, opening and closing, telescoping and 
  contraction, are all interpreted by the fan as a mere agitation or unfolding 
  of a surface. The tradition of nonsense writing in the late nineteenth century, 
  as extended into the work of Beckett and absurdism and modernism’s art of flatness, 
  draws up to the surface of the writing, a sort of indifference or wasteful, 
  trivial, masturbatory playfulness, which is precisely, pointless, never comes 
  to a point.</font></p>

</font></b><font size="3">
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Flatness is the most important 
  quality of paper, but printing brought into being a new form of flatness, in 
  the card. The playing-card is the ideal form of a network of cards and labels 
  of all kinds that characterise the modern world since the advent of printing. 
  The playing-card arrived in Europe only after the mid-14th century, with the 
  advent of wood-block printing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Playing cards are known 
  as ‘flats’, a word which has also been applied to the gullible victims of the 
  operations of ‘card-sharps’. Indeed the musical pun is literalised in the expression 
  ‘playing sharps and flats’, meaning engaging in the tricking of fools. There 
  is also an interesting commerce between flatness and skin in gaming slang. The 
  victim of a cheating or a fixed game is said to have been ‘skinned’ in the sense 
  of fleeced. Losing your shirt may be another version of this idea. Farmer and 
  Henley record that the term ‘skin-faro’, refers to a cheating version of the 
  game, in which the dealer takes up two cards rather than one. Eric Partridge’s 
  <i>Dictionary of the Underworld</i> gives us a ‘skin-house’ for a gambling-den, 
  and a ‘skin-game’ for any game that is fixed. Although it is possible to be 
  ‘skinned’ in any rigged game, whether it be dice or roulette, or any other game 
  involving stakes, the transference of the metaphor from the process to the means 
  of the process is easier when the medium is playing-cards. For cards resemble 
  the paper-money the movement of which they bring about more than any other form 
  of gaming. Indeed, it may be that the suspicion which attached to the introduction 
  of paper money, that conspicuously weightless form of transaction, may have 
  borrowed its sense of the dangerous impalpability and anonymity of paper from 
  the card-table. Playing cards also anticipate the massive multiplication of 
  tickets and cards and labels of all kinds from the eighteenth-century onwards: 
  visiting cards, tickets of admission, etc.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">American college slang supplies 
  more evidence for the association between cheating, trickery and the skin. According 
  to Farmer and Henley, a ‘skin’ is a crib, often a translation of a text, especially 
  when it is conveyed into the examination room on the palm of the hand. The idea 
  behind this metaphor seems to be not just that the skin provides the surface 
  for the inscription, but also that the inscription has come about by means of 
  an impression, contact, or palm-to-palm printing-off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Being skinned at the table 
  is given a literal application in Richard Head’s <i>The English Rogue</i>, a 
  collection of japes and mischiefs, in which a young man is tricked by his lover 
  and ends up being stripped and flogged by her irate husband. Returning naked 
  to his lodgings, he covers himself with a story of a disastrous session at cards 
  or dice:</font></p>
<dir> 
  <dir> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">His Landlady (who was 
      a Widow) seeing him in this condition, charg’d him home, asking, where he 
      had been, how he came thus to lose his skin? Whether he had been rob’d? 
      Though wanting Garments, yet he would not be without a Cloak to hide this 
      venereal enterprize of his, and therefore replied, that falling into ill 
      company, it was his ill hap to fall into that damn’d itch, that tickling 
      humour of playing; that having won something, and like to win more, they 
      would not let him play longer, but seizing him, stript him, and would have 
      done, I know not what, had not his flight procured his safety. (Head 1671: 
      51)</font></p>

</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So card-playing and gambling 
  games in general as a thought of skin, thought thinned to the hectic flatness 
  of skin, and the risk of being reduced by trickery to the condition of the dupe 
  or ‘flat’. But ‘flat’ seems to be a later term. More common in the heyday of 
  gaming, from the Restoration to the mid eighteenth century, is the word ‘bubble’. 
  The term probably derives from the South Sea Bubble, and signifies any swindling 
  attempt to raise money based on a dubious or non-existent foundation. By transference 
  of meaning, the bubble becomes the one taken in by this insubstantiality, and 
  ‘bubbling’ the process of cheating or swindling such a victim. The bubble might 
  seem to be the opposite of the flatness of a card or a surface, in all its richness, 
  delicacy and depth. But, of course, a bubble is the ruse of substance, the appearance 
  of depth and dimension only. A bubble is nothing but a surface stretched over 
  air, stretched out by air itself, as though air itself had taken shape by being 
  given a skin, which is itself as close as possible to being air. The membrane 
  of the bubble is a conceptual borderline too, at the absolute minimum of mass 
  that is able to hold itself together without either coagulating or shattering. 
  In a bubble, thinness is given form; the form of a bubble depends upon this 
  extreme thinness. The bubble is so tenuous that it is almost untenable, cannot 
  sustain touch; a bubble is a thing of the mind, an image of the mind, but cannot 
  be thought without implicit touch. Francis Quarles brings mind and world together 
  in this beautiful little sequence in his <i>Emblems</i>: ‘What is lighter than 
  the mind? A thought. Than thought? This bubble world.’ In each case, what is 
  enclosed is assumed to be lighter and less substantial than what encloses. If 
  the mind can have thoughts, and these thoughts can be of the whole world then, 
  so the sudsy reasoning goes, the world must be nothing but the filmiest emanation 
  of thought. The bubble world of capital, gambling and paper wealth is a subtle 
  body, in the airborne insubstantiality of flatness.</font></p>
<font size="3">
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because of, not despite 
  the fact of their superficiality, the fact that they have no insides, games 
  can and do include the world. One of the first written reports we have of card-playing 
  in Europe, a manuscript written in Germany in 1377, observes that, in card-playing, 
  ‘the state of the world as it now is is excellently described and figured’ (quoted 
  in Beal 1975: 7). A Royalist pamphlet of the English Civil War similarly folds 
  together the world of battle and the world of cards. It is entitled <i>The bloody 
  Game at Cards, As it was played betwixt the King of Hearts. And the Rest of 
  His Suite, against the residue of the packe of cards. Wherein Is Discovered 
  where faire play was plaid and where was fowle. Shuffled at London, Cut at Westminster, 
  Dealt at Yorke, and Plaid in the open field by the Citty-clubs, the country 
  Spade-men, Rich-Diamond men and Loyall Hearted Men</i> (no date, no publisher 
  named).</font></p>
</font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Precisely because games 
  seem to represent or incorporate the whole world, they can displace or assimilate 
  the world, erasing distinctions between levels on the indifference of the table 
  or the play-ground. The author of a pamphlet entitled <i>The Ten Plagues of 
  England</i> in 1757 wrote that, as a result of gambling,</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Persons of distinguished 
      Fortunes and estates have been not only impoverished, but likewise become

      Estate as a single Guinea; and, while the Infatuation is predominant, it 
      is equal to the better; he cannot, at that Juncture, discern the Misery 
      that may ensue, nor how soon his Family may be brought upon a Level with 
      the meanest Individual; nor does he then in the least consider that his 
      Country calls aloud for him to a more noble Game, where even Death is honourable, 
      and Victory the Prize; where Life is despicable without Valour, and Courage 
      is rewarded with Immortality. (Anon 1757: 16-17)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gambling and gaming means 
  tabular life, life rased to an ecstatic plane. Gambling flattens and emaciates 
  its victims, like consumption, as evoked by Callimachus, the opponent of gambling 
  who is given what is meant to be the clinching arguments in Jeremy Collier’s 
  <i>Essay Upon Gaming</i> of 1713:</font></p>
<dir> 
  <dir> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Things lose their Strength 
      and Complexion, and grow lean and languishing; and there’s not much Foresight 
      requir’d to pronounce upon the Event. The Neglect of Business, the Misadventures 
      at Play, the licentious Extravagance consequent to it, bring on the Decay 
      apace; the Hectick comes forward to a galloping Consumption, and the Symptoms 
      appear mortal. (Collier 1713: 24)</font></p>

<font size="3">
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The skin is identified with 
  the self; it is what the self sees and displays of itself. Losing one’s skin 
  is losing one’s very self - so that when Michel Angelo depicts himself flayed 
  in the <i>Last Judgement</i> on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, it is his cast-off 
  skin that retains his identity and acts as his visual signature. But, because 
  the skin, the sign of self, is so fragile and can so easily be imagined as being 
  stripped off, it is also the means by which the self can be imagined as subject 
  to transformation, trickery and transaction. The wearing of animal skins is 
  regularly associated with the powers of healing, or the taking on of new or 
  different selves, while invisibility is often conferred in stories by means 
  of a cloak. The skin is the sign of the self’s transactability as a sign. </font></p>
</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As such, it will regularly 
  suggest erotic transaction. The danger of gaming for women in particular is 
  that it the game will expand beyond the game, that it will bring into play not 
  only the money brought to the table, but the lady’s entire fortune, and finally, 
  her body and with it her honour. One is always gambling with one’s honour, gambling 
  with the possibility that one’s honour will come to be at stake, or be forfeit. 
  Women appear to have been drawn into card-gaming in large numbers from the mid 
  seventeenth century onwards. Their bold involvement in gambling was much remarked 
  upon. Although he supposes men to be even more dangerously reckless in gambling, 
  Jeremy Collier asks ‘Have we not heard of Ladies losing hundreds of Guinea’s 
  at a Sitting? And others more slenderly stock’d, disfurnish their Husbands Studies, 
  and play off the Books, which it may be help’d to feed them’ (Collier 1713: 
  22) The new association between women and gambling allows, or produces a kind 
  of hystericisation of card-gaming. Ihough the favoured image is that of ‘galloping 
  consumption’ it is those playing it who are consumed. Gaming is represented 
  often as a sort of anorexia, reducing the body’s fullness, and especially the 
  fullness of the female body, and especially during the great wave of female 
  card-playing from the mid seventeenth century to the end of the eighteenth, 
  to helpless, spectral flatness. As Richard Steele reported:</font></p>
<dir> 
  <dir> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[T]here is nothing that 
      wears out a fine Face like the vigils of the Card Table, and those cutting 
      Passions which naturally attend them. Hollow Eyes, haggard Looks, and pale 
      Complexions, are the natural Indicators of the Female Gamester. Her Morning 
      Sleeps are not able to repair her Midnight Watchings. I have known a Woman 
      carried off half dead from Bassette. and have, many a time grieved to see 
      a Person of Quality gliding by me, in her Chair, at two a Clock in the Morning, 
      and looking like a Spectre amidst a flare of Flambeaux. (Quoted in Hartmann 
      1930: xvi).</font></p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The particular vulnerability 
  of the skin to the wearing effects of gaming is attested to in Disraeli’s novel 
  <i>The Young Duke</i>. At the end of a card session that has cost him £100,000 
  the young duke of the title resolves to play no more, declaring ‘I am a young 
  man, and cannot play tricks with my complexion.’ When the gamester is a gamestress, 
  she surrenders her whole life, the solidity and volume of her body, to the game. 
  She is reduced to febrile skin, even as she risks losing her skin, being skinned 
  by it. Gambling is such a serious matter because it involves the energetic exchange 
  of goods of real value - losing the shirt off your back, and then the very skin 
  off your back. For the true gambler, the delight and peril and delirium of the 
  table come from its capacity to resolve everything into this same near-indifference, 
  which then vastly accelerates the possibility of accelerated transfers: the 
  flatness of the gaming table is the indifference that can trigger the possibility 
  of vast differentials. The story goes that Archimedes was offered a reward for 
  successfully overseeing the military defence of Alexandria. He asked for a chess-board 
  to be brought and a grain of wheat to be placed on the first square, two on 
  the next, then four, then eight, and so on, doubling each time. The grain required 
  to fulfil the bargain would have exceeded the grain production of the whole 
  of Egypt for decades. Or try this: take a sheet of rice paper, 1000th of an 
  inch thick. Fold it over on itself. Fold it over again, and again, 50 times. 
  The resulting column will be - seventeen million miles high. The raising of 
  stakes, the running beyond measure which tabulation, the flatness of the board, 
  seems uniquely to encourage, embodies both erotic danger and possibility. When 
  a woman has once been corrupted, suggests De Flores in Middleton’s <i>The Changeling</i>, 
  her dishonour ‘spreads and mounts like arithmetic’.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gambling invokes a kind 
  of flat time. In one sense, there is no time at all in gambling, time loses 
  its meaning. But time is all that is left, too: gambling swallows up time. ‘It 
  is momentary and eternal. The variety and vicissitudes of its movements forestall 
  disgust while providing it with perpetual sustenance over which time holds no 
  sway’ (Barbeyrac 1709: 286-7, trans. in Kavanagh 1994: 61). Here passion combines 
  with indifference. The time spent in the game is time lost, time spent doing 
  the same thing over and over again, an image of the churning of indifference. 
  And yet the time of the game is marked off from worldy time: it is more intense 
  and concentrated. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This indifference is to 
  be found replicated in the bodies and especially the faces of gamblers. According 
  to Jean Dusaulx’s <i>De la passion du jeu</i> (1779), gamblers become the same 
  kind of visible emptiness of the game, the anything goes of complete contingency 
  given a bodily form:</font></p>
<dir> 
  <dir> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What particularly characterizes 
      gamblers is their lack of any character. Their tumultuous and contrary feelings 
      reciprocally destroy each other and leave only confused traces. They have 
      the faces of lost men with no distinct physiognomy. (Dusaulx 1779: I, 133, 
      trans in Kavanagh 1994: 36)</font></p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kavanagh sees gambling as 
  the last upsurgings of an aristocratic culture of the gift in the growing economic 
  rationality of the Enlightenment. But, on the other hand, the world of the gambling 
  table was beginning to resemble the world of economics, in which speculation 
  and calculation of probabilities would play a larger and larger part. This, 
  too, was a ‘flat’ world, as was the world of the <i>Encyclopédie</i> 
  itself, that document and model of total knowledge in the eighteenth century. 
  The <i>Encylopédie</i> ‘brings together an unintegrated multiplicity 
  of elements whose value lies outside any overarching system imposed upon its 
  parts. Refusing such integration, the whole retains its status as a purely alphabetical 
  conglomerate whose constituent parts remain free to establish new and unsuspected 
  relations each with the others’ (Kavanagh 1994: 246). It is, in fact, a flat 
  infinity, the unity of which consists in its permutability, the skin of adjacency 
  that is its attenuated hypostasis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kavanagh interprets gambling 
  as an aristocratic, and pseudo-aristocratic display of excess, indifference 
  to the mere mathematics of money. Castiglione urges the aristocrat to demonstrate 
  his indifference to money. ‘A man had to be able to hazard his fortune on the 
  turn of the cards as coolly as his forefathers risked their lives on the luck 
  of battle, Card-tables at Versailles, where millions of livres were yearly staked, 
  offered a new tournament ground for blood to show its quality.’ (Kiernan 1988: 
  154). This aristocratic ideal of the poker face is found in the writing of de 
  Méré, in the mid seventeenth century: ‘One must always gamble 
  as an honnête homme, and be ready to lose exactly as one might win, such 
  that neither outcome be visible on one’s face or in one’s way of acting.’ (de 
  Méré 1930, quoted Kavanagh 1994: 46). The face and the board, 
  the table, the screen, become interchangeable.</font></p>
<font size="3">
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The gaming table is a membrane 
  separating mind and body: purely physical amusements and exertions, and purely 
  mental actions. Although it would be perfectly possible to play cards in a virtual 
  form, without the physical shapes of the cards or the surfaces on which they 
  are shuffled, cut, dealt, displayed and concealed, as chess masters are able 
  to play several games simultaneously in their heads, the borderline condition 
  of cards, poised between mental action and physical embodiment, is crucial to 
  the phenomenology of card playing. As with any addiction, the accessory supports 
  and rituals come to be an essential part of the addiction. Dolomedes, the hapless 
  proponent of gaming in Jeremy Collier’s mock-debate <i>An Essay Upon Gaming</i>, 
  has an explanation: </font></p>
<dir> 
  <dir> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To command a Dye, or 
      deliver a Bowl; to perform this to Excellence and Exactness, requires great 
      Capacity and Improvement: to do this, we must throw our Understanding into 
      our Limbs; the Brains must circulate like the Blood and the Head and the 
      Hand go together...We must have the Machine perfectly manageable, and our 
      knowledge at our <i>Fingers-end.</i> And to give you a Piece of old Philosophy, 
      I remember at the <i>University</i>, the Matter must be so contriv’d, that 
      the Soul may be <i>tota in toto, &amp; tota in qualibet parte</i>. (Collier: 
      8-9)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cards literally enact the 
  process of giving out and gathering in, of stripping and transferring skins, 
  that is at work in the gambling game. This is not just because cards are as 
  flat as the skin, it is because their flatness also involves the cruelty of 
  the edge - which is to say, the chance: the Red Queen’s axe and her murderous 
  ‘Off with their heads!’ is her harmlessness (‘nothing but a pack of cards’) 
  set on edge. What is the most important thing about a playing-card? Its edge. 
  A playing card can be supported by its edges, resting against another card at 
  an angle. The edges of playing cards are what give them their magic architecture. 
  The edge is what is unencompassable in the flat card. The edge is the possibility 
  of turning, the turn of the card on which so much may depend. It is the reversibility, 
  in an utterly flat world of large and small, death (‘Off with his head!’) and 
  insignificance (‘you’re nothing but a pack of cards’).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Idle Hands</font></p>
</b> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cards also have a mimetic 
  closeness to and intimate involvement with the life of the hand which no other 
  form of gambling possesses. The playing card is designed to be held in the hand, 
  and mimes and multiplies the form of the hand. We speak of a hand of cards, 
  and one of the earliest disciplines that must be acquired by every card-magician 
  is that of palming, or concealing a card in the palm while the back of the hand 
  is presented to the viewer. The reversing of this process, transferring a card 
  from the front of the hand to the back, is known as ‘back-palming’. (Do cats 
  eat bats? Do bats eat cats?) This emphasis on mirror-imaging, on the hand as 
  an abstracted redoubling of the body, with its front and its back at once complete 
  opposites of each other and yet also in intimate community with each other, 
  is what gives playing-cards their particular kind of strange life.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The playing card is both 
  the object of the hand and itself an avatar of the hand, having transferred 
  to it many of the metamorphic powers of the hand. Playing cards are magical 
  partly because they are meaningless in themselves; their power only comes from 
  the signs they carry, and the meaning of those signs in relation to other signs. 
  The meaning of the playing card is its arbitrariness, its flatness, its lack 
  of intrinsic life or meaning, the fact that no card means anything on its own. 
  Its flatness signifies this dry semioticity. Its life comes from contingency 
  and adjacency, from what occurs when it is laid next to another card. In this 
  emptiness of intrinsic form or purpose, the card resembles the hand itself. 
  But card tricks all depend upon the transfer of the conceptual magic of the 
  card to the physical plane, by making the card or deck seem to come to life 
  as a physical object. The card, or run of cards, which should be empty and flat, 
  deriving their meaning entirely from what is made of them, develop autonomous 
  powers. One of the commonest tricks employed by magicians is the forcing of 
  an apparently free choice. This involves presenting the subject of the trick 
  with a fanned out pack, face down, with the invitation to pick out any card. 
  Surprisingly, if the magician nudges forward a particular card, seeming to offer 
  it, there is a good chance that it will be accepted. In seeming to be offered, 
  or rather to offer itself, in this way, gesturing or pointing to itself, the 
  card signifies flat paper taking on the life of the hand, the prestige of the 
  prestidigitator.</font></p>
</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The energetic involvement 
  of the hands in the playing of games has had a great deal to do with its associations 
  with lasciviousness. In the course of his invective against ‘diceplay and other 
  profane gaming’ in 1586, Lambert Danaeus wrote ‘I call all those Games and Playes 
  unhonest, unseemely and unlawfull, wherein there is any euill, unhonest, filthie, 
  unchast or unseemely action, practice or pranke, as namely, lasciuious talke 
  and wanton words, unchast groapings and ribald handlings, unshamefact gestures 
  and fancieful behauiours’ (Danaeus 1586: C2r, F2v-F3r). The particular form 
  of unchaste groping and ribald handling that is most commonly associated with 
  gambling is masturbation, that great universal metaphor of our relationship 
  to the world. In his essay on Dostoevsky, Freud associated gambling with masturbation: 
  </font></p>
<font size="3">
<dir> 
  <dir> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ‘vice’ of masturbation 
      is replaced by the addiction to gambling; and the emphasis laid upon the 
      passionate activity of the hands betrays this derivation. Indeed, the passion 
      for play is an equivalent of the old compulsion to masturbate; ‘playing’ 
      is the actual word used in the nursery to describe the activity of the hands 
      upon the genitals. The irresistible nature of the temptation, the solemn 
      resolutions, which are nevertheless invariably broken, never to do it again, 
      the stupefying pleasure and the bad conscience which tells the subject he 
      is ruining himself (committing suicide) - all these elements remain unaltered 
      in the process of substitution. (Freud 1988: 459).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The devil is closely implicated 
  in games of chance, and especially dice, with which he shares his name. And 
  the devil is, as everybody knows, a masturbator; his deceptions and simulations 
  and fibbery and fancification are masturbatory. The devil, as we know, makes 
  work for idle hands. The great assault upon the vice of masturbation through 
  the nineteenth century and beyond was predominantly an economic affair. Masturbation 
  was a waste of time, strength and vital power. It was a diffusion of the energies 
  required to gather and hold together the self in fruitless pleasure. But masturbation, 
  as a form of illicit play, or an illicit playing with the idea of play, had 
  been associated with the parasitic frivolity of gaming from early times. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Masturbation has traditionally 
  been thought of as the opposite of life, the primitive, empty, narcissistic, 
  mirror-image, piratical simulation of real life, thinning its energy, its ecstatic 
  eminence and potential into flatness. In the mirror-play of masturbation, mirror 
  on mirror mirrored is all the show, and ‘itself is all the like it has’ (Dickinson 
  1970: 401). When two surfaces come together, according to heterosexual fantasy, 
  there can only be repulsion or inert equivalence, not the energising interchange 
  of opposites. (Hence perhaps, the insulting historical term ‘flat-fuck’ for 
  a particular lesbian act, or fantasy of one.) For the nineteenth century, masturbation 
  was regarded in the light of a remorseless bioenergetics, bent on conserving 
  energy, as negativity, as the waste of energy or potential; as the mode of the 
  parasite. But surfing, the thousand plateaux which spread out from our culture 
  of simulation and stimulation, has become intimately associated with masturbation, 
  single, double and multiple. The conjoining of surfaces has become the topology 
  of desire, involving now a positive energetics, a charging through waste. The 
  internet is sometimes thought of carelessly as involving disembodiment, but, 
  if so, it is a disembodiment of a particular kind, one that is announced in 
  the tabulations of the Enlightenment. It is a disembodiment into flatness, into 
  the energetic life of that abstract skin. The haggard, lantern-jawed masturbators 
  that haunt the imagination of nineteenth-century sexual theorists are the embodiments 
  of Thomson’s second law of thermodynamics, pointing to the inevitable dissipation 
  of energies and purposes in the universe. They are the demonic shadow of that 
  other thermodynamic demon, Maxwell’s demon, which preserved energy differentials; 
  the masturbator is a dissipator of tensions. The masturbator is the on the other 
  side of all those hearty, heroic strivers and turners to account, the Dickenses, 
  the Trollopes and the Harriet Martineaus. But the masturbators of the nineteenth 
  century have won and the moralists have lost. Our age of information is nothing 
  other than the apotheosis of the onanist.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If one were to start from 
  somewhere else, from the history of the sensation of itch (Connor 2000), there 
  would be a plane of immanence to be formed between gambling, which I want to 
  have shown you is the speculation of and on surfaces, writing, and sexual desire. 
  There are, traditionally, three things for which you itch: sex; to write; and 
  to game. Itch provides the tegument across which they can communicate. The itch 
  to scribble is often thought of as a displacement of sexual desire; but scribbling 
  is also speculation, and sexual speculation is at work on the card-table. All 
  of them are evoked as an itch, by which I mean, an unappeasable desire, a desire 
  for unappeasable desire, or the desire to perpetuate the desire for the end 
  of desire. All of them are itchy sensations because of the need of friction 
  or abrasion which both expresses and sustains them. Who wants satisfaction, 
  in sex or in scratching? We scratch to intensify itch, we play to lose in order 
  to have a reason to continue the play. What is so brilliantly called ‘surfing 
  the internet’, in an idiom the spread of meanings of which I am here reaching 
  after, seems to convene all of these proliferative superficialities. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Deleuze’s account of sports 
  which join one to a rhythm, rather than initiating a rhythm of one’s own, or 
  overcoming a resistance, complements Sartre’s account of skiing in <i>Being 
  and Nothingness</i>:</font></p>
<dir> 
  <dir> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We got by for a long 
      time with an energetic conception of motion, where there’s a point of contact, 
      or we are the source of movement. Running, putting the shot, and so on: 
      effort, resistance, with a starting point, a lever. But nowadays we see 
      movement defined less and less in relation to a point of leverage. All the 
      new sports - surfing, windsurfing, hang-gliding - take the form of entering 
      into an existing wave. There’s no longer an origin as starting point, but 
      a sort of putting-into-orbit. The key thing is how to get taken up in the 
      motion of a big wave, a column of rising air, to "get into something" 
      instead of being the origin of an effort. (Deleuze 1995: 121).</font></p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The difference between skiing 
  and windsurfing embodies an important and almost allegorically obvious difference 
  between Sartre and Deleuze. For does not Sartre speak of the appropriative activity 
  of the individual, the for-itself which cleaves through empty space, colonising 
  it, making it its own through its projects, while for Deleuze there are no for-itselfs 
  and in-itselfs, but only conjugation and adjacency, no projects, only slewings, 
  divagations and branchings? How, for Deleuze, could there be a for-itself, a 
  being taking itself as an issue for itself, under these conditions? What makes 
  Sartre and Deleuze resonate with each other, is the shared assumption of flatness. 
  This entering in to the wave, or joining oneself to the lift of the thermal, 
  belong to what Deleuze in his later work called the ‘plane of immanence’, the 
  making out of which is life and the lively work of inventing concepts which 
  is thinking. They represent the effort to yoke things together, rather than 
  to propel them or make them from nothing, to have things move in parallel, like 
  two surfaces sliding over one another. It is an abrogation of perpendicular 
  thinking and action. It seeks immanence rather than eminence, moves alongside 
  rather than to and from. Surfing and sliding and skiing and skidding and glissando, 
  all forms of participative interfacing, are beginning to govern our thinking. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Joining one’s energy to 
  a wave, or a force, therefore hitching a ride on it: but this is not quite how 
  it works when one surfs the internet. For if the internet seems like an infinite 
  resource with infinite powers of connotation, drawing one sideways, beckoning 
  one on, yet there is no source for the energy, nothing behind it, except our 
  own curiosity. The internet provides an ideal field for gaming and the self-multiplications 
  of solitaire sexuality. It no longer depends upon paper, but it does not take 
  place in thin air either. The internet, like the universe, is flat, spreading 
  out uniformly, through replication. This is what ensures that it has no shape 
  of its own, that it has neither been bent into uniformity, nor exploded into 
  absolute multiplicity. </font></p>
</font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And in (on? amid?) the internet, 
  masturbation is not just an occasional possibility, it is a general mode. The 
  mobile phone has become the favoured mode of connection, because the telephone 
  allows one to stay in touch, with yourself, with self-touching itself. Digital 
  technology means that you can let your fingers do the talking. The office prank 
  that involves pressing the hand, or, more commonly, other, more erotically rounded 
  parts of the body against the photocopier, represents the delight and aspiration 
  of flat-life, of planitude. Peter Greenaway’s <i>Belly of An Architect</i> gives 
  us the bulky, unplaceable, mysteriously interior life of the body - specifically 
  the abdominal body, the ‘deepest’ part of the body - turned into skin, into 
  an endless series of photocopies, which invade the visible surface of the film. 
  And the screen, that great imaginary sublimation of the page and the playing 
  card, provides the as-if surface for all of these transactions. It is becoming 
  our shape: the thought of the shape of our thought.</font></p>
