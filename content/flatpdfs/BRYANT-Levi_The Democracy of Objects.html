<div class="epigraph">
<div class="q1-epig">
<p> The rock was one of those tremendously solid brown, or rather black, rocks
                     which emerge from the sand like something primitive. Rough with crinkled limpet
                     shells and sparsely strewn with locks of dry seaweed, a small boy has to
                     stretch his legs far apart, and indeed to feel rather heroic, before he gets to
                     the top. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> But there, on the very top, is a hollow full of water, with a sandy bottom;
                     with a blob of jelly stuck to the side, and some mussels. A fish darts across.
                     The fringe of yellow-brown seaweed flutters, and out pushes an opal-shelled
                     crab— </p>

<a name="10.1"></a><h3>6.1. Two Ontological Discourses: Lacan's Graphs of Sexuation and Two Ways of
               Thinking Being </h3>
<p> Onticology proposes what might be called, drawing on DeLanda's term yet broadening
               it, a flat ontology. Flat ontology is a complex philosophical concept that bundles
               together a variety of ontological theses under a single term. First, due to the split
               characteristic of all objects, flat ontology rejects any ontology of transcendence or
               presence that privileges one sort of entity as the origin of all others and as fully
               present to itself. In this regard, onticology proposes an ontology resonant with
               Derrida's critique of metaphysics insofar as, in its treatment of beings as
               withdrawn, it undermines any pretensions to presence within being. If this thesis is
               persuasive, then metaphysics can no longer function as a synonym for “metaphysics of
               presence”, nor substance as a synonym for “presence”, but rather an ontology has been
               formulated that overcomes the primacy of presence. In this section, I articulate this
               logic in terms of Lacan's graphs of sexuation. Here I believe that those graphs have
               little to tell us about masculine or feminine sexuality—for reasons I will outline in
               what follows—but a great deal to tell us about ontologies of immanence or flat
               ontologies and ontologies of transcendence. Second, flat ontology signifies that <span class="rend-i">the</span> world or <span class="rend-i">the</span> universe does not
               exist. I will develop the argument for this strange claim in what follows, but for
               the moment it is important to recognize the definite article in this claim. The claim
               that the world doesn't exist is the claim that there is no super-object that gathers
               all other objects together in a single, harmonious unity. Third, following Harman,
               flat ontology refuses to privilege the subject-object, human-world relation as either
               a) a form of metaphysical relation different in <span class="rend-i">kind</span> from
               other relations between objects, and that b) refuses to treat the subject-object
               relation as implicitly included in every form of object-object relation. To be sure,
               flat ontology readily recognizes that humans have unique powers and capacities and
               that how humans relate to the world is a topic more than worthy of investigation, yet
               nothing about this establishes that humans must be included in every inter-object
               relation or that how humans relate to objects differs in kind from how other entities
               relate to objects. Finally, fourth, flat ontology argues that all entities are on
               equal ontological footing and that no entity, whether artificial or natural, symbolic
               or physical, possesses greater ontological dignity than other objects. While indeed
               some objects might influence the collectives to which they belong to a greater extent
               than others, it doesn't follow from this that these objects are more <span class="rend-i">real</span> than others. Existence, being, is a binary such that
               something either is or is not. </p>
<p> Apart from the fact that I believe these propositions to be ontologically true, the
               broader strategic import of the concept of flat ontology is to diminish the obsessive
               focus on the human, subjective and the cultural within social, political, cultural
               theory and philosophy. In particular, my ambition is to diminish an almost exclusive
               focus on propositions, representations, norms, signs, narratives, discourses, and so
               on, so as to cultivate a greater appreciation for nonhuman actors such as animate and
               inanimate natural entities, technologies, and such. To be clear, in seeking to
               diminish a focus on these sorts of actors, my aim is not to <span class="rend-i">exclude</span> these sorts of actors. Rather, I seek both to synthesize divergent
               trends within contemporary Continental social, political, cultural, and philosophical
               thought and broaden the field of inquiry available to these discourses and debates.
               Within the framework of contemporary Continental thought, it would not be too far off
               the mark to say that there are <span class="rend-i">two</span> highly different cultures.
               Within the one culture, we have a focus on lived experience, text, discourse,
               signifiers, signs, representation, and meaning. This is a form of inquiry dominated
               by figures such as the various phenomenologists, Derrida, Lacan, Žižek, and Foucault,
               for example. Here there is very little in the way of a discussion of the role played
               by nonhuman actors in collectives involving human beings. Rather, nonhuman entities
               are treated as screens upon which humans project their intentions, meanings, signs,
               and discourses, rather than as genuine actors in their own right. They are instead
               passive matter awaiting formatting by humans. This is not entirely fair to the
               theorists of this culture, as Foucault devotes a great deal of attention to
               institutions, architecture, and practices, while Derrida recognizes the importance of
               simple agencies like writing in the most literal sense and digital encoding, yet
               nonetheless, these are dominant tendencies within this culture or orientation of
               theory. </p>
<p> By contrast, the other culture ranges widely over nonhuman actors or objects and
               pays careful attention to the differences contributed by nonhuman agencies such as
               technologies, animals, environments, and so on. Here we might think of monumental
               intellects such as Donna Haraway and Katherine Hayles, the work of McLuhan, Kittler,
               Ong, and Stiegler, the later work of Deleuze and Guattari, the thought of Latour and
               Stengers, engagements with technology such as that found in Ian Bogost's work,
               pathbreaking work such as that found in Protevi, DeLanda, and Massumi, ecologists
               like Timothy Morton, Marx's meditations on how the money-form, technologies, and
               factories change our very identities, critical animal theorists such as Cary Wolfe,
               and a host of other thinkers. Within this culture, we find two important trends. On
               the one hand, there is a tendency to decentralize the human by describing the impact
               of the nonhuman in the form of technology and other inhuman agencies on collectives
               involving humans and how these agencies cannot be reduced to human intentions, signs,
               meanings, norms, signifiers, discourses, and so on. </p>
<p> On the other hand, there is, in this culture, a speculative tendency, deserving of
               the title of “Spinozism”, that ranges freely over the “experience” of nonhuman
               entities, plumbing the worlds of other entities without being obliged to relate
               everything back to the human. Graham Harman's universe is a universe populated by
               circuses and clowns, vampires, unnamed monsters, fire and cotton, and a host of other
               frightening and delightful carnivalesque entities that erupt across his pages like so
               many apparitions that simultaneously withdraw and capture us with their inherent
               fascination and allure. Jane Bennett's universe is inhabited by the vital forces of
               abandoned bottle caps, dead rats, trash heaps undergoing various forms of
               bio-chemical decomposition, and a host of other objects. Ian Bogost is currently
               writing his<span class="rend-i"> Alien Phenomenology</span>, which promises to bring us
               into the subterranean experience of all sorts of other entities such as computer
               software we scarcely notice in our day to day existence. Donna Haraway's universe is
               pervaded with wolves, microbes, lab reports and articles, various types of primates,
               plants, and all sorts of laboratory equipment. Karen Barad's universe is populated by
               all sorts of particles, instruments and waves. </p>
<p> What I aim for with the concept of flat ontology is a synthesis of these two
               cultures. I desire an ontology capable of doing justice to these strange nonhuman
               actors, capable of respecting these strange strangers on their own terms, and an
               ontology capable of doing justice to the phenomenological and the semiotic. Moreover,
               I believe that such a project is absolutely vital to the future of contemporary
               thought. The first of these two cultures is regnant in the contemporary world of
               theory. The aim of diminishing the primacy of the human is not nihilistic nor
               designed to exclude the human, but is premised on the thesis that, so long as the
               first culture maintains center stage, we are thoroughly unable to properly comprehend
                  <span class="rend-i">human</span> collectives nor theorize strategic ways of
               transforming them. In this connection, flat ontology makes two key claims. First,
               humans are not at the center of being, but are <span class="rend-i">among</span> beings.
               Second, objects are not a pole opposing a subject, but exist in their own right,
               regardless of whether any other object or human relates to them. Humans, far from
               constituting a category called “subject” that is opposed to “object”, are themselves
               one <span class="rend-i">type</span> of object among many. </p>
<p> The difference between philosophies of transcendence and philosophies of immanence
               such as those advocated by the flat ontology of onticology can be thematized in terms
               of Lacan's graphs of sexuation. Here my aim is to argue that onticology and its
               conception of objects aligns itself with the feminine side of Lacan's graph of
               sexuation. Before proceeding to outline this congruence and the difference between
               ontological discourses organized around withdrawal and ontological discourses
               organized around presence (the masculine side of Lacan's graphs of sexuation), it is
               first necessary to make some qualifications. Within the history of philosophy, there
               has been a long history of associating women with nature, being, and passivity
               coupled with an objectification of women that denies them agency as subjects in their
               own right. Onticology certainly does not wish to align itself with these unfortunate
               tendencies, yet doesn't it risk doing precisely this in arguing that the true
               discourse of being falls on the side of the feminine side of Lacan's graphs of
               sexuation? Moreover, doesn't it fall into an even worse plight in treating being as
               composed of objects? </p>
<p> There are a few points worth making in response to this entirely justified concern.
               First, and above all, it is necessary to recognize that it is difficult to see what,
               if anything, Lacan's graphs of sexuation have to do with sex or gender. As Bruce Fink
               articulates this point, </p>
<div class="q1-block"> [i]t should be recalled that sexuation is not biological sex: What
               Lacan calls masculine structure and feminine structure have to do not with one's
               biological organs but rather with the kind of <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> one
               is able to obtain. There is not, to the best of my knowledge, any easy overlap
               between sexuation and “sexual identity”, or between sexuation and what is sometimes
               referred to as “sexual orientation”. [...]. When I refer to men in the ensuing
               discussion, I mean those people who, regardless of biological sex, fall under certain
               formulas—what Lacan calls “the formulas of sexuation”—[...] and when I refer to
               women I mean those people who, regardless of their biological sex, fall under the
               [feminine side] of the formulas.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_265" id="link_note_265" class="note-footer-link">[265]</a>
</div>
<p> Having spent more time than I care to admit with the Lacanian secondary literature
               and the seminars in which he develops his account of sexuation, I believe that Bruce
               Fink is essentially correct in this judgment. While Lacan does indeed articulate two
               different structures of the deadlocks that beset desire and <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span>, it is not at all clear why these two structures should be called
               “masculine” and “feminine”. In my view, Lacan fails to establish any direct link
               between these structures and sex and gender. For example, any subject, whether
               biologically male or female—assuming, questionably, that we can even speak univocally
               of subjects being biologically male or female—can occupy either side of Lacan's
               graphs of sexuation. Put differently, biologically “male” subjects can enjoy or fail
               to enjoy as feminine subjects and biologically “female” subjects can enjoy or fail to
               enjoy as masculine subjects. </p>
<p> The strongest argument in favor of associating the graphs of sexuation with the
               masculine and the feminine arises from the fact that the masculine side of the graph
               of sexuation can be read as a highly abstract and formalized version of the structure
               of Freud's patriarchal Oedipus Complex and myth of the Primal Father in <span class="rend-i">Totem and Taboo</span>. If the Oedipus Complex and the myth of the
               Primal Father are understood to be intrinsically patriarchal and phallocentric
               structures, then there is some reason to associate the masculine side of the graph of
               sexuation with forms of <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> and desire related to
               masculinity. However, here again we encounter the question of why the feminine side
               of the graph of sexuation should be associated with women. We could just as easily
               refer to the two sides of the graphs of sexuation as outlining logics of immanence
               (the feminine) and logics of transcendence (the masculine), or logics of the
               “not-all” (the feminine) and logics of exception (the masculine). </p>
<p> A second point to be made is that in arguing that the objects of onticology and
               object-oriented philosophy fall on the feminine side of the graphs of sexuation, it
               is imperative to recall that, within the framework of onticology, objects are neither
               passive nor a pole opposed to the subject. Within the framework of object-oriented
               ontology, there are not two domains of being, one belonging to the domain of the
               subject, the other belonging to the domain of the object, but rather just one type of
               being: objects. On the one hand, we can thus say that subjects are not a pole opposed
               to objects, but are themselves a type of object. They are objects among other
               objects. To be sure, what we refer to as subjects have special powers and capacities,
               but they are nonetheless a sort of object in the world. On the other hand, far from
               being passive clods awaiting formatting from humans and getting worked over by
               humans, objects, as theorized by onticology, are themselves, following Latour, actors
               or actants that are themselves agents. In this regard, treating objects as falling on
               the feminine side of the graphs of sexuation in no way suggests that women are
               passive objects. To the contrary, the feminine side of the graph of sexuation turns
               out to be the side of agency. </p>
<p> With these caveats in mind, I now turn to Lacan's graphs of sexuation. I will first
               discuss the graphs of sexuation within the framework of Lacanian theory and then
               reformulate them in ontological terms. Lacan's graphs of sexuation attempt to
               symbolize or display certain deadlocks that occur whenever we attempt to totalize the
               symbolic order or the world. Lacan argues that whenever we attempt to totalize the
               world, certain deadlocks emerge preventing such totalities from being successfully
               accomplished. Because of the absence and metonymy introduced into the world of the
               subject by language, Lacan contends that each potential object of <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> contains a remainder of absence or lack that prevents it from
               conferring complete enjoyment. Complete enjoyment would require the totalization or
               completion of the symbolic, yet such totalizations always fail. Moreover, there is
               not merely one way in which we attempt to totalize the world and for this
               totalization to fail, but rather two ways. These two ways of failing are what Lacan
               refers to as the “masculine” and the “feminine”. These two forms of failure, in their
               turn, generate two very different structures of desire and <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span>. Put differently, depending on how the subject is structured as
               either a “masculine” or a “feminine” subject, different forms of <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> will be available to the subject. The term “<span class="rend-i">jouissance</span>” is highly polysemous within Lacanian theory, however within the
               framework of the graphs of sexuation we can treat <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span>
               as the sort of enjoyment open to a subject. Put more precisely, the two graphs
               explain why our <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> comes up <span class="rend-i">short</span> or lacking as a result of our being enmeshed within the symbolic
               order. As Bruce Fink remarks, “[w]e find the pleasures available to us in life
               inadequate, and it is owing to that inadequacy that we expound systems of
               knowledge—perhaps, first and foremost, to explain why our pleasure is inadequate and
               then to propose how to change things so that it will not be”.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_266" id="link_note_266" class="note-footer-link">[266]</a>
            </p>
<p> Within the Lacanian framework, this deficit of <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> is
               not accidental but rather <span class="rend-i">structural</span>. In other words, our
               deficit of <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> arises not from an accidental lack such
               that if we could only find the appropriate object we would experience complete
               enjoyment, but rather is a structural feature of how we are enmeshed in language or
               the symbolic order. These structural impossibilities of complete <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span>, in their turn, generate fantasies to account for both why <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> is lacking and how this lack might be surmounted.
               For example, racists are often particularly attentive to the <span class="rend-i">imagined jouissance</span> of other groups, believing these groups to both possess
               a greater <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> than themselves, and believing that the
               other group has perhaps stolen their <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> from them. The
               racist might endlessly talk about how the other group is lazy, how they get free
               rides from the government, how they are promiscuous, how they lack moral values, and
               so on. Based on such fantasies, the racist might imagine all sorts of ways to take
               action against these other groups so as to get back their stolen <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span>. It's not difficult to discern such mechanisms at work in
               misogyny and homophobia as well. The tragedy of this sort of <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> is two-fold. On the one hand, these dark fantasies lead to the
               persecution of other people and groups based on an imagined <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> that one believes these other groups have stolen. The pursuit of
                  <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> purported to be lost and stolen thus riddles the
               social field with conflict. On the other hand, the belief that total <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> exists, that it is possible to attain complete <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span>, makes it all the more difficult to enjoy the <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> that is available because it always falls short of
               imagined <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span>. As a consequence, the subject suffers
               from fantasies of total <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> that transform life into
               cold ashes. Filled with envy at the <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> one believes to
               be enjoyed by other groups, and crushed by bitterness at the absence of <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> in one’s own life, the subject becomes unable to
               enjoy anything. </p>
<p> To illustrate the structural deadlocks that arise when we attempt to totalize the
               symbolic order, Lacan resorts to the resources of symbolic logic:<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_267" id="link_note_267" class="note-footer-link">[267]</a>

</div>
<p> The upper portions of the graph filled with equations refers to the structural
               deadlocks that inhabit the symbolic. The left side is the masculine side, whereas the
               right side is the feminine side. These refer to logics of exception and the “not-all”
               respectively. The symbols that appear in the lower portion of the graph refer to the
               sorts of <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> available to subjects depending on whether
               they fall under the left or right-hand side of the graph. Within symbolic logic, “∃”
               is what is known as an “existential quantifier”. Existential quantifiers refer to
               partial collections such as “some”, “many”, “one” and so on. Thus, for example, the
               proposition “some cats are black” would be written in symbolic logic as follows: ∃xCx
               &amp; Bx. Translated back into ordinary language, this would read, “there exists at
               least one entity such that this entity is a cat and this entity is black”. The upper
               case letters are thus predicates qualifying a subject or entity, while the lower case
               letters are variables or arguments. Similarly, in symbolic logic, the symbol “∀” is
               what is known as a “universal quantifier”. Universal quantifiers refer to expressions
               such as “all” and “every”. Thus, the proposition “all humans are mortal” would be
               translated into symbolic logic as follows: ∀xHx → Mx. Translated into ordinary
               language, this would read, “for all entities, if x is human then x is mortal”. The
               arrow thus reads as a conditional or an “if/then” statement. Finally it will be noted
               that over some of the expressions in the upper portions of Lacan's graph a bar
               appears. This bar denotes negation. Within what follows, I will use the following
               symbol to denote negation: “~”. </p>
<p> In all four of the propositions populating the upper portion of Lacan's graph of
               sexuation we notice the symbol “Φ” appearing as a predicate qualifying “x”. Within
               the framework of the upper portion of the graphs, this symbol refers to the phallic
               function. Like many of Lacan's mathemes, Φ is highly polysemous depending on the
               context in which it appears. Within the present context, Φ does not refer to the
               phallus—at least in the upper portion of the graph—much less to the male organ of the
               penis. Rather, Φ refers to castration, our submission to language, or our submission
               to the Law. In other words, Φ refers to the manner in which we must pursue <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> through language and therefore encounter a priori
               restrictions or limitations to <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span>. </p>
<p> We are now in a position to read the propositions in the upper portion of Lacan's
               graphs of sexuation. The top and bottom propositions are to be read together or in
               relation to one another as embodying a sort of deadlock or contradiction. Thus, on
               the left or masculine side, the top proposition reads ∃x~Φx, while the bottom
               proposition reads ∀xΦx. Translated into ordinary language, the first proposition
               reads, “there exists an entity such that this entity is not subject to the phallic
               function”, while the second proposition reads, “for all entities, x is submitted to
               the phallic function”. When read together, the deadlock or contradiction embodied in
               these two propositions is that of a fantasy held by the subject in which complete
               enjoyment is possible, coupled with an existence where all <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> comes up short by virtue of being subordinated to the phallic
               function. </p>
<p> One of the great advantages of Lacan's abstraction in these formulations is that it
               allows us to discern a common structure in a number of diverse domains. Not only does
               Lacan's handful of symbols allow us to discern the basic structure of the Oedipus
               Complex and the myth of the Primal Father in <span class="rend-i">Totem and Taboo</span>,
               but we can also see it as articulating the basic relationship between a monarch and
               his subjects, God and his creatures, the Cartesian subject and other objects, a
               celebrity and his fans, and so on. In each of these cases, we have the <span class="rend-i">fantasy</span> of a subject that either has complete knowledge,
               complete power, or complete enjoyment coupled with a plurality of subjects or
               entities that are lacking in knowledge, power, or enjoyment. In the case of the
               Primal Father, for example, we have an entity that has no limitations on his <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span>. Not only does he possess all the women of the
               tribe, he is also able to enjoy incest with his mother and daughters. Similarly, in
               the case of the Oedipus, the subject encounters a limit to his enjoyment in the
               incest prohibition. Likewise, in <span class="rend-i">The Concept of the Political</span>,
               Schmitt's monarch enjoys a strange status of exception, simultaneously being above
               and outside the law and therefore enjoying absolute power, while also being the
               origin of the law (castration/limitation).<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_268" id="link_note_268" class="note-footer-link">[268]</a> What we thus get here is a logic of universality defined by exception. In
               order for the universal to establish itself in the form of the law, there must be a
               shadowy and phantasmatic exception that allows the boundary of the law to establish
               or ground itself. The sovereign need not truly have absolute power, nor must the
               Primal Father really have existed. All that is necessary is the unconscious belief in
               such exceptions to the failure of <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span>. If it proves
               impossible to totalize the symbolic order under this model, then this is because such
               totalization always requires an impossible exception outside that order, whereas the
               signifier is always differentially constituted without positive terms. </p>
<p> On the feminine side of the graph of sexuation, we get not a logic of exception, but
               a logic of the “not-all”. The top proposition of the feminine side of the graph of
               sexuation reads, ~∃x~Φx, while the lower proposition reads, ~∀xΦx. Translated into
               ordinary language, the first proposition reads, “there does not exist an entity that
               is not submitted to the phallic function”. By contrast, the second proposition reads,
               “not all of x is submitted to the phallic function”. In other words, on the feminine
               side, something escapes from the law of language, castration, or the phallic
               function. It will be noted that whereas the masculine side constitutes a universal
               (the universality of the law) through an exception, we find no exception on the
               feminine side, nor do we find any universality. Instead of universality, what we find
               is the “not-all” or the “not-whole”. Two consequences follow from this: first,
               insofar as there is no constitutive exception within the structure of feminine
               sexuality, this structure can be described in terms of <span class="rend-i">immanence</span>. Where the structure of masculine sexuality presupposes a
               transcendent term outside the world or law in some way or another, within the field
               of feminine structure we find only a flat plane with no transcendent outside or
               exception. </p>
<p> Second, the absence of a constitutive exception leads to Lacan's much maligned and
               misunderstood claim that <span class="rend-i">the</span> woman does not exist.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_269" id="link_note_269" class="note-footer-link">[269]</a> Here we must attend to the role of the definite article in Lacan's
               formulation. Lacan's thesis is that, in order for a class to constitute itself as
               existing or universal, there must be an exception that defines the rule. If,
               according to Lacan, we can say what a male is, then this is because all men share the
               common characteristic of being castrated or subordinated by the Law defined by the
               phallic function. This law is guaranteed by the constitutive exception that allows
               the law to be determined. There is no analogous instance on the feminine side of the
               graph of sexuation, therefore it is impossible to constitute a universal class of
               women. The upshot of this is not that <span class="rend-i">women</span> do not exist, but
               rather that <span class="rend-i">woman</span>, the woman, does not constitute a closed and
               defined class. Put in more positive terms, women belong to the set of the <span class="rend-i">singular</span>, the individual, the different. They form an open set
               without any shared or overarching predicate defining a universal identity, thereby
               undermining any pretension to essence or identity. </p>
<p> In response to the failures of totalization found on both sides of the graph of
               sexuation, forms of <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> appear as attempts to
               supplement and surmount this failure. On the masculine side we witness $, the symbol
               for the barred subject, pointing at <span class="rend-i">a</span>, the matheme for <span class="rend-i">objet a</span>. It will be noted that the form of <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> that appears on the masculine side of the graph of sexuation also
               has the structure of Lacan's formula for fantasy, ($ &lt;&gt; a), read “barred
               subject punch <span class="rend-i">objet a</span>”. In chapter four, we already saw that
                  <span class="rend-i">objet a</span> is the remainder produced as a result of the
               subject's entrance into language. As a consequence, <span class="rend-i">objet a</span> is
               not an empirical or existing object, but a sort of remainder, excess, or irreducible
               fractional quantity marking that which cannot be integrated into the symbolic. Lacan
               refers to the <span class="rend-i">objet a</span> not as the object of desire, but as the
               object-cause of desire. <span class="rend-i">Objet a</span> forever propels the masculine
               subject forward, seeking a lost object he never had to begin with. Nonetheless,
               within the framework of fantasy, while <span class="rend-i">objet a</span> is not the
               object of desire but the cause of desire, various objects come to function as
               surrogates or stand-ins for <span class="rend-i">objet a</span>. Within the domain of
               unconscious fantasy, these surrogates are thought as that which, if destroyed or
               gained, would complete the subject, allowing the subject to surmount the lack that
               characterizes his being. In this respect, all fantasies are dual, organized like a
               Möbius strip, containing both a hypothesis as to what must be gained in order to
               surmount lack <span class="rend-i">and</span> a hypothesis as to what caused the loss of
               that object which would complete him. For example, the anti-Semite might believe that
               Jews are responsible for his economic woes and that money would provide the
               satisfaction that he seeks. This belief in the possibility of total <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> arises from the upper proposition of the masculine side of the
               graph of sexuation, ∃x~Φx, and the unconscious belief that either an uncastrated
               subject exists or is possible. </p>
<p> Lacan often refers to phallic <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> or the sort of <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> found in <span class="rend-i">objet a</span> as deferred
                  <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span>. As Bruce Fink puts it, “Lacan associates
               phallic <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> with organ pleasure, the pleasure of the
               genitalia [...]; the idea here is that one must endlessly defer or altogether give up
               organ pleasure to obtain another kind of pleasure”.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_270" id="link_note_270" class="note-footer-link">[270]</a> Part of the reason for this deferral is that, were the subject to actually
               reunite with the semblance of <span class="rend-i">objet a</span>, he would discover that
               the semblance of <span class="rend-i">objet a</span> is not “it”. Thus, for example, Lacan
               argues that obsessionals, which are associated with masculine sexuation, have a
               desire for an impossible desire.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_271" id="link_note_271" class="note-footer-link">[271]</a> Through a fantasy structure organized around an impossible desire, the
               masculine subject can thereby sustain his desire and protect against the
               disappointment of <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> coming up short. </p>
<p> In many respects, masculine <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> can be described as
               solipsistic and masturbatory. In <span class="rend-i">Encore</span>, Lacan notoriously
               claims that there is no sexual relationship.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_272" id="link_note_272" class="note-footer-link">[272]</a> In the case of the masculine sexuated subject, whether biologically male or
               female and whether one's partner is male or female, we can see how this is the case.
               The masculine sexuated subject relates not to his partner <span class="rend-i">qua</span>
               subject, but rather to <span class="rend-i">objet a</span>. Returning to our discussion of
               the Lacanian clinic in chapter 4, the masculine sexuated subject attempts to reduce
               or abolish the subject as Other, as autopoietically closed, relating only to the
               Other's demand and <span class="rend-i">objet a</span>. I refer to this way of relating to
               the Other and the world as “Malkovichism”. In Spike Jonze's <span class="rend-i">Being
                  John Malkovich</span>, we are told the strange tale of a passage in an office
               building that allows you to enter John Malkovich's mind and experience what it is
               like to be John Malkovich for fifteen minutes. At a certain point in the film, John
               Malkovich becomes wise to what is going on and himself goes through the passage. When
               Malkovich goes through the tunnel and experiences his own experience, he has the
               harrowing experience of seeing everyone else, male and female, with his own head,
               speaking not ordinary language, but endlessly repeating his name: “Malkovich!
               Malkovich! Malkovich!” In short, Malkovich is forcibly confronted with his own
               narcissism and phallic economy of <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span>. What we
               encounter here is correlationism in its purest form. Within the correlationist frame
               of thought, the world is reduced to a passive screen that merely reflects our
               intentions, meanings, signs, narratives, and discourses. Within the masculine economy
               of <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span>, one relates not to the partner but to Žižek's
               ticklish object which functions like a strange attractor bringing the subject into
               existence. In this connection, Lacan makes the joke that masculine <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> is “<span class="rend-i">hommosexual</span>”. Here Lacan is punning on
               the French “<span class="rend-i">homme</span>” or “male”, and “homosexuality”. His point
               is not that all men are homosexuals, but rather that masculinely sexuated subjects
               desire the same or identity and therefore strive to banish the alterity encountered
               in desire. Lacan's point is not that men only desire other men, but rather that
               masculine desire desires the <span class="rend-i">same</span> in the form of <span class="rend-i">objet a</span> or the fetish object. </p>
<p> On the feminine side of the graph of sexuation we encounter a very different form of
                  <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span>. On the one hand, we see not one arrow, as in
               the case of masculine sexuation, but rather two arrows. On the other hand, we see not
               the barred subject, $, but rather the barred “<span class="rend-i">La</span>”. <span class="rend-istrike">La</span> refers to non-existent woman that cannot be
               totalized under a single category or identity. In the lower portion of the feminine
               side of the graph of sexuation, we see an arrow pointing at Φ. Here we encounter the
               polysemy of Lacan's mathemes. In this context, Φ does not seem to represent the
               phallic function or castration, but rather power, potency, or a master. Lacan's
               somewhat sexist thesis here seems to be that the feminine sexuated subject, whether
               biological male or female, can find <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> by identifying
               with a partner that embodies Φ. Such a subject might be someone that possesses
               political power, knowledge, celebrity, prestige, physical strength, skill, and so on.
               The idea would thus be that the feminine sexuated subject, who can find no signifier
               within the symbolic to define or fix her identity, identifies with Φ so as to confer
               an identity upon herself. Whereas <span class="rend-istrike">La</span> marks the
               inability for language to complete or totalize itself and therefore an inability to
               produce a fixed or stable identity within the symbolic, √ creates the <span class="rend-i">illusion</span> of a fixed or stable identity. In this regard we can
               see the impossibility of the sexual relation in terms of feminine sexuation, insofar
               as the femine sexuated subject relates to his partner not as a subject but as a
               semblance of Φ. </p>
<p> This reading of <span class="rend-istrike">La</span> as it relates to Φ seems to
               recommend itself as a consequence of Lacan's discourse of the hysteric, which Lacan
               associates with the feminine. In the discourse of the hysteric, we have the barred
               subject addressing itself to the master or master-signifier, demanding to be told
               what it is: </p>
<div class="figure"><a href="./BRYANT-Levi_The Democracy of Objects_files/9750134.0001.001-00000013.png"><img src="./BRYANT-Levi_The Democracy of Objects_files/9750134.0001.001-00000013.png" alt="" title="" class="thumbfigure"></a></div>
<p> In the discourse of the hysteric, the subject addresses the Other or master from the
               standpoint of his split. This split results from the inability of the symbolic or
               language to provide the subject with a signifier that would fix or name his identity
               within the symbolic. In short, the hysterical subject calls on the other to tell him
               what he is. This inability of language to provide a signifier that would found the
               subject arises from the essence of language itself. As Lacan remarks in <span class="rend-i">The Logic of Fantasy</span>, “it is of the nature of each and every
               signifier that it cannot signify itself”.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_273" id="link_note_273" class="note-footer-link">[273]</a> Insofar as the signifier cannot signify <span class="rend-i">itself</span>, it
               always requires <span class="rend-i">another</span> signifier to produce effects of
               signification. In this respect, signifiers have the structure of sets that do not
               include themselves, and Lacan does not hesitate to draw a parallel with Russell's
               paradox pertaining to the impossibility of a set of all sets that do not include
               themselves. The net result of this is that there cannot be a “universe of discourse”
               or totality of language because it will always be beset by paradox from within.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_274" id="link_note_274" class="note-footer-link">[274]</a> The consequence of this is that there can be no stable signifier that could
               ground the subject's identity, for each signifier will necessarily refer to another
               signifier without any possibility of completeness. It is this structure of language
               that accounts for the divided structure of the subject. Moreover, in the position of
               truth in the discourse of the hysteric, we encounter <span class="rend-i">objet a</span>
               as that remainder that is always lost within language. It is this remainder that
               literally drives the subject forward, forever looking for that signifier that would
               ground identity, and further alienating himself through his speech. The product of
               this discourse, we note, is knowledge, S<sub>2</sub>, produced as a
               result of the hysteric's demand. Indeed, Lacan claims that the discourse of the
               hysteric is the only discourse that produces knowledge.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_275" id="link_note_275" class="note-footer-link">[275]</a> In this connection, we can treat Φ and the master or S<sub>1</sub> to which the hysteric addresses himself as equivalent. </p>
<p> At this point, there are a couple of points worth noting. Attentive readers will
               have noted that I have been referring to the hysterical subject in masculine terms.
               First, while Lacan associates hysteria with the feminine, any neurotic subject that
               undergoes analysis must enter into the discourse of the hysteric or begin asking the
               question “what am I for the Other?” Second, and more fundamentally, however, both
               Lacan and Freud argue that the subject is, at root, a hysterical subject. As Žižek
               puts it, “the status of the subject as such is hysterical. The subject is constituted
               through his own division, splitting, as to the object in him; this object, this
               traumatic kernel, is the dimension that we have already named as that of 'death
               drive', of a traumatic imbalance, a rooting out”.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_276" id="link_note_276" class="note-footer-link">[276]</a> If the subject is hysterical at its core, then this is because both masculine
               and feminine neurotic subjects undergo the same alienation in language and therefore
               encounter the same paradoxical structure of language with respect to its inability to
               totalize or complete itself. In this vein, Žižek goes on to remark that, </p>
<div class="q1-block"> hysteria and obsessional neurosis are not two species of neurosis
               as a neutral-universal genus; their relation is a dialectical one—it was Freud
               himself who noted that obsessional neurosis is a kind of “dialectic of hysteria”:
               hysteria as a fundamental determination of a neurotic position contains two species,
               obsessional neurosis <span class="rend-i">and itself as its own species</span>.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_277" id="link_note_277" class="note-footer-link">[277]</a>
</div>
<p> At root, at the most fundamental level, the subject is hysterical in its structure
               such that obsessional neurosis is a subspecies of hysteria. </p>
<p> The importance of this observation is not to be underestimated. If it is true that
               subjectivity is at root hysterical, if it is true that obsession is a subspecies of
               hysteria, and if it is true that hysteria is associated with feminine sexuation and
               obsessional neurosis is associated with masculine sexuation, we find that we are able
               to invert a fundamental characterization of woman throughout Western history.
               Generally we hear that woman is characterized by masquerade, deception, semblance,
               inconsistency, and so on. However, in light of the foregoing, it would appear that in
               point of fact it is masculinity that is a charade, a semblance, a masquerade. And
               indeed, this is clearly visible in Lacan's discourse of the master. </p>
<div class="figure"><a href="./BRYANT-Levi_The Democracy of Objects_files/9750134.0001.001-00000012.png"><img src="./BRYANT-Levi_The Democracy of Objects_files/9750134.0001.001-00000012.png" alt="" title="" class="thumbfigure"></a></div>
<p>Lacan associates the discourse of the master with obsessional neurosis and therefore
               with masculine sexuation. In the position of truth in the lower left-hand corner of
               this discourse, we witness the barred subject, $, which is nothing other than the
               hysterical subject. As a consequence, the master-signifier that appears in the
               position of the agent in the upper left-hand corner must be a charade, a semblance,
               or a masquerade. What the foregoing entitles us to claim is thus that the feminine
               side of the graph of sexuation is the structure of truth, whereas the masculine side
               of the graph of sexuation is the side of semblance. Moreover, we can now say that the
               totalization that masculine sexuation attempts to effect through the logic of
               exception is a semblance that strives to erase and cover over the constitutive split
               of being.</p>
<p> The second arrow on the feminine side of the graph of sexuation points not to Φ, but
               rather to S(<span class="rend-strike">A</span>). S(<span class="rend-strike">A</span>)
               refers to what Lacan calls “Other <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span>”, which is a form
               of <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> outside the symbolic that Lacan associates with
               the experience of mystics.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_278" id="link_note_278" class="note-footer-link">[278]</a> Because not-all of woman is subject to the phallic function, the feminine
               sexuated subject, whether male or female, is capable of a <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> outside the symbolic. Echoing Lacan's thesis that masculine
               sexuated subjects are “hommosexual”, we could say that in light of Other <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span>, S(<span class="rend-strike">A</span>), feminine
               sexuated subjects are the true “hetero-sexuals”. Here the “hetero” of hetero-sexual
               should not be read as claiming that women only desire men, but rather that feminine
               sexuality is structured in such a way that it is capable of desiring <span class="rend-i">alterity</span> or the Other <span class="rend-i">qua</span> Other,
               regardless of whether the other subject is biologically male or female. </p>
<p> Having made this detour through Lacan's graphs of sexuation in terms of desire and
                  <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span>, I now turn to the question of how these
               structures relate to flat ontology. We have already seen that Lacan's graphs of
               sexuation have no clear or unambiguous link to biological sex or gender. Biologically
               male subjects can occupy the feminine side, just as biologically feminine subjects
               can occupy the masculine side. Moreover, we have seen that, as structures, these
               graphs are able to represent a wide variety of diverse formations. Likewise we have
               seen that the graphs represent failures of totalization. Finally, we have seen that
               the masculine side of the graph of sexuation refers to semblance, whereas the
               feminine side of the graph of sexuation refers to truth. </p>
<p> Without excluding the reading of Lacan's graphs in terms of sexuation, desire, and
                  <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span>, I propose to read these graphs in terms of
               ontological discourse and, in particular, in terms of withdrawal. This reading is not
               designed to have any argumentative or demonstrative force, but rather is designed to
               outline how the discourse of onticology and object-oriented ontology differ from
               other ontological discourses. Moreover, this treatment of onticology in terms of the
               graphs of sexuation will, I hope, allow us to see more clearly what is entailed by a
               flat ontology. Under this reading, the phallic function or Φ is no longer treated as
               the phallic function or castration, but rather as the ontological function of <span class="rend-i">withdrawal</span>. In the foregoing, we have already seen how objects
               are constitutively withdrawn from other objects. This withdrawal takes two forms: on
               the one hand, objects are withdrawn in the sense that they are always in excess of
               any of their local manifestations. Objects always have a virtual domain that is never
               exhausted by any of their local manifestations. On the other hand, objects are
               withdrawn in the sense that they are never directly perturbed or “irritated” by other
               objects, but rather always translate perturbations into information according to
               their own endo-structure, organization, or distinctions. Φ refers to this
               constitutive withdrawal of objects. </p>
<p> In this respect, the two sides of Lacan's graphs of sexuation refer to the manner in
               which different ontological discourses handle or treat this dimension of withdrawal
               within objects. Rather than referring to these structures as “masculine” and
               “feminine”, I now refer to the two sides of Lacan's graphs as ontologies of presence
               and ontologies of withdrawal respectively. Likewise, ontologies of presence can be
               referred to as ontologies of transcendence, whereas ontologies of withdrawal can be
               referred to as ontologies of immanence. Ontologies of transcendence refer to
               ontologies where some being or term stands apart from the world, thereby immunized
               from withdrawal. Such ontologies are organized around the logic of exception outlined
               in the foregoing. By contrast, ontologies of immanence refuse any such term, treating
               all of being as composed of a single flat plane in which <span class="rend-i">all</span>
               beings are subject to withdrawal. Both forms that ontology takes relate to withdrawal
               but do so in very different ways. </p>
<p> On the side of ontologies of transcendence, we encounter the following propositions:
               ∃x~Φx and ∀xΦx. The first proposition now reads, “there exists an entity such that
               that entity is not withdrawn”. The second proposition now reads, “for all entities,
               these entities are withdrawn”. As abstract as this formulation is, it allows us, I
               believe, to capture the core hypothesis of philosophies of presence or ontotheology.
               On the one hand, whether we're speaking of the God of ontotheology or the traditional
               subject of philosophy embodied in Descartes' thought, we encounter a term that is not
               itself withdrawn, but which is fully present to <span class="rend-i">itself</span>. This
               is true even of Hume's mind or Kant's structure of experience, where their critiques
               of metaphysics are premised on some form of consciousness or experience that is
               present to <span class="rend-i">itself</span>, but where there is no direct access to <span class="rend-i">other</span> objects. Hume, for example, is able to advance his
               critique of causality and the notion that objects are inhabited by “hidden powers”
               while arguing that cause and effect relations are associations drawn by <span class="rend-i">mind</span> on the grounds that mind is <span class="rend-i">present</span>
               to itself, whereas causal relations and powers are <span class="rend-i">withdrawn</span>
               from mind. Likewise, Kant is able to argue that substance, for example, is a category
               imposed by <span class="rend-i">mind</span> on the manifold of intuition producing
               phenomena, while also arguing that things-in-themselves are unknowable on the grounds
               that mind is present to itself, while objects are withdrawn. A good deal of
               philosophy influenced by the linguistic turn has this structure as well. Language
               here is treated as what is present, whereas objects are withdrawn. Finally, in
               theology, within this framework God is treated as a fully self-present term, while
               all of God's creatures are treated as finite, imperfect, and incomplete. </p>
<p> What we find in all variants of the ontologies of presence and transcendence is thus
               a term that is treated as present or immune to the function of withdrawal. As a
               consequence of this structure, withdrawal comes to appear as <span class="rend-i">accidental</span> rather than as an essential feature of all objects. Withdrawal is
               treated as something to be <span class="rend-i">overcome</span>, rather than as a
               structural feature of being. Here we encounter the function of <span class="rend-i">objet a</span> in ontologies of presence. <span class="rend-i">Objet a</span> is that
               remainder or leftover within representation that eludes complete presence. However,
               the premise here is that this remainder is not a constitutive feature of the being
               itself, but rather is an accidental feature of the relativity of our representations.
               Put a bit differently, objects are seen as withdrawn <span class="rend-i">for-us</span>
               and fully present <span class="rend-i">in-themselves</span>. In this regard, withdrawal is
               a sort of “optical effect” produced as a result of how <span class="rend-i">our
                  representations</span> hook on to the world, rather than as a structural feature of
                  <span class="rend-i">objects</span> themselves. This is true even of skeptical variants
               of ontologies of presence such as Hume's where the thesis is not that entities are
               in-themselves withdrawn, but rather where the thesis is that we have no direct access
               to entities by virtue of how we represent entities. </p>
<p> This discussion of ontologies of transcendence provides me with the opportunity to
               distinguish between epistemological realism and ontological realism, the latter of
               which is advocated by onticology and object-oriented philosophy. Any confusion of the
               ontological realism advocated by onticology and object-oriented philosophy and
               epistemological realism is doomed to be disastrous, as these two forms of realism
               belong to entirely different registers. Epistemological realism is a variant of the
               ontologies of presence that strives to bring objects or the world to presence in an
               adequate representation. The concern of epistemological realism is to represent the
               world and objects as they <span class="rend-i">are</span> and to sort between true
               representations, illusions, and superstitions. As such, epistemological realism
               treats the withdrawal of objects as an accident that can, in principle, be overcome
               by the proper form of inquiry. It is for this reason that epistemological realisms
               remain within the domain of ontologies of presence or ontotheology. </p>
<p> The ontological realism advocated by onticology and object-oriented philosophy, by
               contrast, is what Graham Harman has called a <span class="rend-i">weird</span>
                  realism.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_279" id="link_note_279" class="note-footer-link">[279]</a> The realism advocated by object-oriented ontology and onticology is not an
                  <span class="rend-i">epistemological</span> thesis, but an <span class="rend-i">ontological</span> thesis. This realism is not a thesis about how we know things,
               but rather about how things <span class="rend-i">are</span>. On the one hand, onticology
               refuses to reduce entities to <span class="rend-i">constructions</span> by other entities.
               To be sure, every entity translates the other entities to which it relates, yet these
               translations must be rigorously distinguished from the entities that are translated.
               In this regard, every entity is an irreducible entity in its own right. On the other
               hand, onticology and object-oriented philosophy are the thesis that entities are
               constitutively withdrawn from one another. In other words, withdrawal is not an
               accidental feature of how mind represents entities, but is rather a structural
               feature of what beings or entities are as such. In this regard, onticology and
               object-oriented philosophy are able to retain many of the insights of <span class="rend-i">anti-realism</span>, while situating them in <span class="rend-i">ontological</span> terms. Here, following Žižek, onticology and object-oriented
               philosophy can proclaim that we are healed by the spear that smote us.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_280" id="link_note_280" class="note-footer-link">[280]</a> Withdrawal, far from being an accident of how mind, representation, or
               language hooks on to being, is instead a constitutive feature of all beings. </p>
<p> Turning to the ontologies of immanence, we now encounter two very different
               propositions: ~∃x~Φx and ~∀xΦx. If these propositions characterize an ontology of
               immanence, then this is because there is no longer a transcendental term that is
               exempted from withdrawal. Rather, as the first proposition reads, there does not
               exist an entity that is not subject to withdrawal. If, for example, God exists, God
               is necessarily withdrawn with respect to itself <span class="rend-i">and</span> God's
               creatures are withdrawn from <span class="rend-i">God</span>. In short, even God has no
               privileged or omniscient access to its creatures, nor even to himself. Likewise,
               subjects are both withdrawn from themselves and other beings are withdrawn from
               subjects. Withdrawal is thus not an accidental feature of beings, but is rather a
               constitutive feature of beings. Moreover, withdrawal is not simply a relation between
               one entity and another, but is the core of each entity itself. In this regard, <span class="rend-i">every</span> entity, up to and including God if God exists, is like a
               Lacanian divided or barred subject, $, such that, regardless of whether or not it is
               related to another entity, each entity is withdrawn with respect to itself. Put
               differently, no entity is fully self-present to itself, but rather every entity
               necessarily contains blind spots or is opaque to itself. Withdrawal here is the very
               structure of entities, not an accidental relation of how one entity relates to
               another entity. In short, such ontologies are ontologies of immanence in that no
               entity escapes withdrawal either for-itself or in-itself. </p>
<p> However, while there is no entity that is not subject to withdrawal, the side of the
               graph pertaining to ontologies of immanence also indicates that <span class="rend-i">not
                  all</span> of entities are withdrawn. This thesis is expressed by the lower
               proposition on the feminine side of the graph of sexuation. Here something of the
               entity manifests or presents itself in the world through actualization or local
               manifestation. In short, withdrawal is never so thorough, never so complete, that
               local manifestation in one form or another is impossible. Returning to the themes of
               chapter two, we thus encounter the basic structure of objects in the relation between
               the top and bottom propositions on the feminine side of Lacan's graph of sexuation.
               There we saw that the basic structure of objects is to simultaneously be withdrawn
               and self-othering. No object directly relates to another object and every object is
               in excess of any of its actualizations, yet objects undergo self-othering through
               their local manifestations. Something of the object presents itself to the world.
               However, here we must be careful to note that this presentation or local
               manifestation is not a presentation to the gaze of a subject, but rather is an event
               that takes place in the world regardless of whether any entity is present to register
               this local manifestation. </p>
<p> The difference between ontologies of transcendence and ontologies of immanence is
               thus evident. In the case of ontologies of transcendence, withdrawal is an accidental
               feature of objects. Here, while objects might indeed be withdrawn <span class="rend-i">from us</span>, objects are entirely present <span class="rend-i">to themselves</span>.
               Moreover, subject, mind, and language are invariably treated as present or immune to
               withdrawal within these ontologies. In the case of ontologies of immanence, by
               contrast, withdrawal is not an accident, but a constitutive feature of all objects.
               Withdrawal constitutes the very structure or being of their being. Here objects are
               not only withdrawn <span class="rend-i">from themselves</span> such that every object is
               akin to a Lacanian divided subject, $, but objects are always withdrawn from one
               another. In this regard, local manifestation is not a presentation of an object that
               presents “part” of the withdrawn object such that, were there enough local
               manifestations, the object would be completely presented and withdrawal would be
               overcome. Rather, local manifestation is always the production or creation of a new
               quality that actualizes powers of the virtual proper being of the object without
               rendering virtual proper being itself present. Virtual proper being is necessarily
               abyssal such that it never comes to presence. In this respect, the agency of virtual
               proper being can only ever be inferred through the variety of qualities an object
               produces in its local manifestation. It can never itself be directly encountered for,
               as we saw in chapter 3, virtual proper being is structured without being qualitative. </p>
<p> Within discourses organized around ontologies of immanence, the mathemes populating
               the lower portion of the feminine side of Lacan's graphs of sexuation now take on a
               new valence. S(<span class="rend-strike">A</span>) continues to signify Other <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span>, yet Other <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> is no
               longer an ineffable <span class="rend-i">jouissance</span> outside the symbolic, but
               rather is an attentiveness to what Timothy Morton has called “the strange stranger”.
               Describing the strange stranger, Morton writes, </p>
<div class="q1-block"> [t]he strange stranger [...] is something or someone whose
               existence we cannot anticipate. Even when strange strangers showed up, even if they
               lived with us for a thousand years, we might never know them fully—and we would never
               know whether we had exhausted our getting-to-know process.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_281" id="link_note_281" class="note-footer-link">[281]</a>
</div>
<p> Indeed, the strange strangers can never be exhausted precisely because withdrawal is
               a constitutive feature of being. However, it would be a mistake to suppose that the
               strange strangers are objects <span class="rend-i">other</span> than <span class="rend-i">us</span>. To think the strange strangers in these terms would be to think them in
               terms of a binary based on identity. On the one hand, there would be the familiar,
               the <span class="rend-i">heimlich</span>, while on the other hand there would be the
               strange stranger, the unfamiliar, the <span class="rend-i">unheimlich</span>. The strange
               stranger would constitute itself as the strange stranger by virtue of its lack of
               proximity to the <span class="rend-i">heimlich</span> or the familiar. It would be that
               which is different <span class="rend-i">from</span>. And in being different from, it would
               be a difference based on identity or the same. </p>
<p> The concept of the strange stranger, however, is a concept without a binary. Rather
               the multiple-composition of being consists of strange strangers all the way down. And
               in this regard, we ourselves are strange strangers not only to other entities, but
               above all to ourselves insofar as withdrawal is not merely a relation of one entity
               to another, but also a relation of entities to themselves. Ontological discourses
               premised on immanence thus relate both to themselves and other objects <span class="rend-i">qua</span> strange strangers. Such discourses welcome the other as a
               strange stranger and acknowledge the strange stranger within themselves or their
               constitutive being as self-othering. In this regard, discourses of immanence are not
               unlike the ethics Lacan ascribes to the analyst. As Lacan remarks, </p>
<div class="q1-block"> [t]he analyst's desire is not a pure desire. It is a desire to
               obtain absolute difference, a desire which intervenes when, confronted with the
               primary signifier, the subject is, for the first time, in a position to subject
               himself to it. There only may the signification of a limitless love emerge, because
               it is outside the limits of the law, where alone it may live. <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_282" id="link_note_282" class="note-footer-link">[282]</a>
</div>
<p> Ontologies of immanence strive to relate to themselves and others as strange
               strangers, in and through their differences. They welcome that difference, remaining
               open to the possibility of surprise, refusing to reduce strange strangers to fixed
               identities. In this regard, they practice the difference between local manifestation
               and virtual proper being. In other words, philosophies of immanence recognize the
               locality of local manifestation and the openness and excess of virtual proper being,
               refusing any reduction of the being of beings to their local manifestations. It is
               this excess that accounts for the strangeness of the strange stranger. Strange
               strangers always harbor an excess within them that refuses any reduction to local
               manifestation. </p>
<p> The difference between how ontologies of transcendence and how ontologies of
               immanence relate to objects can be illustrated in terms of Lacan's discourse of the
               master. </p>
<div class="figure"><a href="./BRYANT-Levi_The Democracy of Objects_files/9750134.0001.001-00000012.png"><img src="./BRYANT-Levi_The Democracy of Objects_files/9750134.0001.001-00000012.png" alt="" title="" class="thumbfigure"></a></div>
<p> One way of thinking about Lacan's discourses are as little machines that propel a
               certain discourse forward. Here the product of each discourse (the lower right-hand
               corner of the discourse) has a paradoxical status in that it is simultaneously
               something produced by the discourse and something that contributes to the
               continuation of the discourse. In the discourse of the master, associated with
               discourses of transcendence, the discourse attempts to identify and define objects,
               yet there is always a remainder, <span class="rend-i">objet a</span>, that evades
               identification. Like a Markov chain, this remainder, in its turn, generates a next
               round of discourse attempting to capture and integrate the remainder. In short, the
               discourse of the master treats the remainder not as a constitutive feature of all
               objects, as the mark of their being as strange strangers, but rather as an accident
               to be surmounted and overcome. In other words, ontologies of transcendence are
               governed by a telos, even if impossible, of attaining full presence. </p>
<p> In the case of the graphs of sexuation, we have already seen how masculine sexuation
               is a structure of semblance whereas feminine sexuation is a structure of truth.
               Masculine sexuation is a reaction to the fundamental split of being that attempts to
               surmount this split and cover it over through the enaction of an exception. This
               carries over into the difference between ontologies of presence and transcendence and
               ontologies of immanence and withdrawal. However, the seeds of this erasure of
               withdrawal can already be detected within ontological discourses organized around
               withdrawal. Within ontological discourses organized around immanence, Φ marks that
               tendency within ontologies of immanence to erase withdrawal. Φ marks the yearning or
               desire for full plenitude or actuality that erases the strange stranger. As such, Φ
               is the seed within immanence upon which the semblance of an exception is constructed.
               However, as we will recall from the discourse of the master, any exception, S<sub>1</sub>, veils $, the barred subject, in the position of truth. In
               other words, S<sub>1</sub>, whether in the form of a master-signifier,
               a transcendental subject, God, consciousness or mind is a semblance or masquerade
               that cloaks and disguises its own withdrawal, parading itself as fully present or
               actual. </p>
<p> Lacan's graphs of sexuation allow us to make our first pass at what constitutes a
               flat ontology. In the first approximation, flat ontology consists in the thesis that
               there are no transcendent terms, no exceptions, no positions “out-of-field”, with
               respect to withdrawal. Here being is flat in the precise sense that all beings are
               characterized by withdrawal and self-othering. In this regard, all beings that
               populate the multiple-composition of being are strange strangers. The consequence of
               this is a democracy of strange strangers. Where there is no hegemon that stands above
               and outside withdrawal as a full actuality, there is only a flat plane composed of
               strange strangers. As Morton puts it, “[d]emocracy implies coexistence; coexistence
               implies encounters between strange strangers”.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_283" id="link_note_283" class="note-footer-link">[283]</a>

</div>
<div class="section textindentlevelx">
<a name="10.2"></a><h3>6.2. The World Does Not Exist </h3>
<p> Crucial to the flat ontology proposed by onticology is the thesis that the world
               does not exist. Alternatively, we could say that the whole does not exist. Here I am
               deeply indebted to Alain Badiou's <span class="rend-i">Logics of Worlds</span> and Timothy
               Morton's dark ecology proposed in <span class="rend-i">Ecology Without Nature</span>. In
                  <span class="rend-i">Logics of Worlds</span>, Badiou demonstrates that every concept of
               the Whole is beset by inconsistency.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_284" id="link_note_284" class="note-footer-link">[284]</a> In <span class="rend-i">Ecology Without Nature</span>, Morton argues that we must
               abandon the concept of nature as a unified whole or milieu within which beings reside
               and with respect to which humans and culture constitute an outside such that nature
               is always “over there”.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_285" id="link_note_285" class="note-footer-link">[285]</a> To my thinking, Morton's conception of being without nature shares a great
               deal of affinity to Latour's concept of “collectives”. In <span class="rend-i">Pandora's
                  Hope</span>, Latour writes that, </p>
<div class="q1-block"> [u]nlike society, which is an artifact imposed by the modernist
               settlement, [the concept of collectives] refers to associations of humans and
               nonhumans. While a division between nature and society renders invisible the
               political process by which the cosmos is collected in one livable whole, the word
               “collective” makes this process central.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_286" id="link_note_286" class="note-footer-link">[286]</a>
</div>
<p> Setting aside Latour's reference to politics, the concept of “society” is, according
               to Latour, based on a distribution or enclosure of beings where nature and society
               are treated as two <span class="rend-i">already</span> collected wholes that are somehow
               supposed to relate to one another while remaining entirely distinct. Society is
               treated as the domain of all that pertains to the human in the form of freedom,
               agency, meaning, signs, and so on, while nature is treated as the domain of brute
               causality and mechanism without agency. As a distinction, the concept of society thus
               encourages us to focus on content and agency, ignoring the role that nonhuman actors
               or objects play in collectives involving human beings. Within the distinction
               pertaining to nature, nature is treated as already gathered and unified and we are
               encouraged to focus on causality and mechanism alone. By contrast, in proposing that
               we replace the concept of society with the concept of collectives, Latour encourages
               us to attend to how associations between humans and nonhumans are formed. </p>
<p> In arguing that nature does not exist, Morton challenges the notion that there is an
               outside to nature or that nature is something other, outside the domain of society.
               As Deleuze and Guattari put it, [t]here is no such thing as either man or nature now,
               only a process that produces the one within the other and couples the machines
                  together”.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_287" id="link_note_287" class="note-footer-link">[287]</a> Neither nature nor being is an outside that we must stretch to reach or that
               is encountered when taking a stroll on Black Forest woodland paths, but rather being
               an immanent field without outside or other. And here, when Deleuze and Guattari refer
               to machines, I see no reason not to treat these machines as objects. In short, a
               collective is an entanglement of human and nonhuman actors or objects. However, here
               it is important to be cautious, for while there are indeed collectives of human and
               nonhuman objects or actors, we must not conclude that collectives as such are
               composed of human <span class="rend-i">and</span> nonhuman actors. Collectives can just as
               easily be collectives of tardigrades and other objects, collectives of planets and
               asteroids, and so on without any human involvement whatsoever. In short, what's
               important about the concept of collectives is that they mark, like the concept of
               regimes of attraction, entanglements of objects in a network or mesh. If Morton is so
               eager to abandon the concept of nature within ecological thought, then this is not, I
               take it, because he wishes to reduce all of being to culture, but because in order to
               properly think ecologically we must overcome the notion that nature is a closed whole
               or totality “over there” or outside of human relations. </p>
<p> If it is so vital for flat ontology to establish that the world does not exist, then
               this is because the world must not be treated as a milieu in which beings or objects
               are contained as parts to a whole. In short, if flat ontology is to truly be flat,
               then it is necessary to establish that the world is not a container within which
               beings are found. Alternatively, it must be shown that the world is not a
               super-object composed of all other objects as sub-multiples that form a harmonious
               whole consisting of beings as complementary and inter-locking parts. As such,
               following Badiou, there is not <span class="rend-i">world</span>, but rather <span class="rend-i">worlds</span>. The universe, which is really only a manner of
               speaking, is a pluriverse or multiplicity of universes. Here, then, it is important
               to observe the role of the definite article in the thesis that “the world does not
               exist”. Generally when we speak of “the world” we mean this as shorthand for the
               totality of all that exists. The thesis that the world does not exist is the thesis
               that no such totality exists nor is it possible for such a totality to be formed.
               Rather being consists entirely of objects and collectives. </p>
<p> There are two ways of arguing that the world doesn't exist, the first of which has
               already been hinted at in chapter five in the context of mereology. Within the domain
               of formal reasoning, Z-F set theory shows the inconsistency of any attempt to form a
               totality or whole. Set theory provides a variety of resources for contesting the
               consistency of any totality or whole, however, here I'll focus on the power set
               axiom. As we've already seen, the power set axiom allows one to take the set of all
               subsets of an initial set. Thus, if we have a set composed of elements {a, b, c}, the
               power set of this set would be {{a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c}}. At
               the level of formal reasoning, if the power set axiom spells the ruin of any whole or
               totality, then this is because it reveals the existence of a bubbling excess within
               any whole or collection. </p>
<p> This is a variation of Cantor's Paradox. Cantor's paradox demonstrates that there
               can be no greatest cardinal number precisely because the power set of any cardinal
               number will necessarily be larger than the cardinal number itself. In a stunning
               inversion of the ancient thesis that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts,
               the power set axiom reveals, to the contrary, that the parts are always greater than
               the whole. As I argued in the last chapter, from a certain perspective each object is
               a crowd, containing within itself a plurality of other autonomous objects that very
               likely “know” nothing of the object of which they are parts. Any whole that does
               manage to establish itself is, as Deleuze has put it, a “One or Whole so special that
               it results from the parts without altering the fragmentation or disparity of those
               parts, and, like the dragons of Balbec or Vinteuil's phrase, is itself valid as a
               part alongside others, adjacent to others”.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_288" id="link_note_288" class="note-footer-link">[288]</a> What the power set reveals is the bubbling pluralism of “the” world beneath
               any unity or totality. Any totality or whole, in its turn, is itself an object or One
               alongside all sorts of other ones. </p>
<p> At the formal level, the real force of the power set axiom lies in the manner in
               which it reveals the <span class="rend-i">possibility</span> of a multiplicity of
               relations and objects within any collective. It will be recalled that any
               exo-relation between objects is potentially itself also an object. If we ask the
               strange question, “<span class="rend-i">when</span> is an object?” we can answer this
               question with the hypothesis that an object is when exo-relations among other objects
               manage to attain operational closure such that their aggregate or
               multiple-composition becomes capable of encountering perturbations as information in
               terms of their own endo-consistency. On the one hand, the power set axiom reveals the
               possibility of a plurality of <span class="rend-i">other</span> objects within any
               collective. On the other hand, the power set axiom discloses the possibility of
               alternative exo-relations among objects, not present in the whole from which the
               subsets are drawn. Finally, the power set axiom reveals the possibility of
               withdrawing objects from their relations to collectives so that they might function
               as autonomous actors, either entering into other collectives, subsystems, or going it
               alone within the order of being. </p>
<p> If, from the standpoint of formal reasoning, the Whole is not, the One is not, or
                  <span class="rend-i">the</span> world does not exist, then this is precisely because
               these subsets, these other possible objects and relations populating the power set of
               the Whole or alleged One are neither counted nor countable within the Whole or One.
               In short, every Whole or One contains an excess within it that is not itself treated
               as a part of the Whole or One. Put differently, such subsets are included in the set
               from which they are drawn, without belonging to it. Yet it is precisely this absence
               of belonging or membership that spells the ruin of the Whole, One, or World. </p>
<p> However, while the formal reasoning of set theory provides us the resources for <span class="rend-i">thinking</span> the nonexistence of the world, it does not <span class="rend-i">establish</span> the nonexistence of the world. Confronted with the
               formal demonstration of excess bubbling within any Whole or totality, one can easily
               respond by pointing out that, as provocative as these formal demonstrations are, the
               concept of World pertains not to what is <span class="rend-i">possible</span>, but to what
               actually <span class="rend-i">exists</span>. In this regard, the demonstration that any
               collection <span class="rend-i">could</span> contain other objects and relations does not
               establish that the World <span class="rend-i">does</span> contain other objects and
               relations not counted within that totality. Since the concept of World pertains to
               those relations and objects that do actually exist, the formal demonstration of the
               inexistence of the World has no purchase on the thesis that the World exists. </p>
<p> If it is to be established that the World does not exist, then what is required is
               not a demonstration of the <span class="rend-i">possibility</span> of the ruin of any
               Whole, but rather the demonstration that <span class="rend-i">in fact</span> the World
               does not exist. The resources for this second argument have already been developed in
               my discussion of operational closure in chapter four. There we saw that every object
               is operationally closed such that it constitutes its own system/environment
               distinction. The paradox of this distinction is that, while it is a distinction
               between system and environment, the distinction itself falls on one side of what it
               distinguishes: the system. In short, the environment/system distinction refers not to
               two present-at-hand entities, systems and environments, but is rather constituted by
               systems themselves. This distinction, in its turn, constitutes the entity's openness
               to its environment, and that openness is always of a selective nature. However, here
               we must be careful to distinguish between the environment of a system and systems in
               the environment of a system. While an object does indeed constitute its environment
               in the sense of constituting those sorts of perturbations to which it is open,
               objects do not constitute other objects or systems in their environment. At best,
               working on the premise that an object is open to some other systems in its
               environment, an object translates perturbations it receives from these other objects. </p>
<p> Two points follow from these observations. First, insofar as environment is
               constituted by the object “drawing” the distinction between system and environment,
               it cannot be said that environments are a present-at-hand milieu in which objects
               exist. As we saw in chapter five in connection with our discussion of developmental
               systems theory, objects construct their environment even as they are often buffeted
               by perturbations from systems in their environment. Second, and in a closely related
               vein, because objects are only selectively open to their environments, it follows
               that objects are not open to all systems in their environment. The tardigrade does
               not belong to the environment of a tree, nor does the tree belong to the environment
               of a tardigrade. Likewise, my three-year-old daughter, <span class="rend-i">qua</span>
               social subject, does not belong to the environment of her toy box. No matter how much
               my daughter yells at the lid of her toy box when it accidentally falls down upon her
               head—and she does, indeed, yell and curse, in her own way, the toy box—the toy box
               does not respond or bow to her will. While she might address her toy box as “little
               brother” for reasons that thoroughly baffle me, the toy box is indifferent to her
               designations and scoldings. One might object that certainly the acoustic resonances
               of her scolding voice perturb the toy box and such an objection would not be
               mistaken. However, the manner in which the vibrations of this tiny voice affect the
               polished oak wood of the toy chest do not entail that that oaken toy box transforms
               these perturbations into information <span class="rend-i">qua</span> voice. Sadly, for my
               daughter, that toy box is as dense as wood. </p>
<p> With Leibniz, perhaps, we can say that there are as many worlds as there are
               objects. What we cannot say, however, is that the World forms any sort of organic
               unity or whole in which all objects interrelate with one another as a compossible
               system. There is no world-system precisely because there is no World. On the one
               hand, contrary to Whitehead, it simply isn't the case that every entity relates to
               every other entity. Many entities fall completely outside local collectives such that
               they are both entirely oblivious to these collectives and such that these collectives
               are entirely oblivious to them. Put differently, there are a number of instances in
               which there is absolutely no resonance between entities. Quite literally, they belong
               to entirely different universes. As in the case of neutrinos that are unable to
               relate to most other particles due to their neutral charge, scientists have to
               painstakingly create apparatuses capable of bringing these entities into relation
               with the entities of our world. On the other hand, even in those instances where
               entities do relate, each entity relates to other entities on its own terms as a
               function of the distinctions it draws and its own peculiar organization. As a
               consequence, there is no whole or totality that can be formed out of the entities
               that populate the world. </p>
<p> The thesis that the World forms an organic totality where no such totality exists
               surreptitiously treats the collective as already formed, as already being there,
               without attending to any of the work and translations required for collectives to
               come into being. It treats collectives as accomplished, while ignoring the arduous
               work required for any collective to form itself. As such, it ignores the antagonisms
               that populate being as well as the lack of resonance between all sorts of objects.
               While the idea of the World as an organic and harmonious unity might prove comforting
               and reassuring, providing us with the sense that we belong to a Whole in which each
               entity has its proper place, such a conception of being does a profound injustice to
               the entities that populate the multiple-composition of being and ends up
               recapitulating the discourse of the master and the logic of ontologies of
               transcendence. Put differently, concepts of World as an organic Whole or totality
               foreclose the strange stranger. Each entity, the story runs, has its proper place
               within the organic totality and is defined by its relation to all others. What is
               thereby abolished is the non-relation of each and every relation and the recognition
               of that which is entirely non-relational with respect to any particular collective or
               entity. </p>
<p> If conceptualizations of the World premised on the organic unity of the Whole
               recapitulate the logic of the discourse of the master and ontologies of
               transcendence, then this is because such discourses inevitably must have recourse to
               some entity that perturbs the “natural” order, preventing it from existing
               harmoniously as ontologies of the World dictate. It is always Man, technology, the
               foreigner and so on that perturbs the “natural” order. In other words, within the
               conception of Nature as an organic whole or totality, there is always recourse to
               some uncanny agency generating disharmony that upsets the harmonic natural order.
               Such conceptions of being necessarily have recourse to <span class="rend-i">objet a</span>
               as a disruptive agency that upsets the “natural” order. Moreover, this disruptive
               agency, this trickster, to use Lévi-Strauss's memorable term, is treated as an <span class="rend-i">accident</span> that could return the natural order to harmony were it
                  <span class="rend-i">eradicated</span>. As such, discourses about the existence of the
               World and the intrinsic harmony of nature end up repeating the friend/enemy logic
               analyzed so attentively by Schmitt. </p>
<p> Yet it is not simply that the idea of the World as an organic and harmonic Whole
               producing <span class="rend-i">objet a</span> as a remainder that is problematic. Rather,
               in declaring that the World exists, that the world forms an organic Whole, all
               objects are subordinated to the World as parts of the Whole. As such, their only
               value and being arises from what they contribute to the World or the Whole as
               elements in this massive machine that swallows them all up in a total system in which
               they're integrated. The consequence here is that the being of the part is completely
               effaced, such that the part becomes merely a functional element providing
               perturbations that the Whole can draw on in producing information in its own ongoing
               autopoiesis. Objects themselves therefore have no autonomy apart from the Whole and
               simply are what they are as elements of the Whole. Gaia, it turns out, is either a
               fascist or a totalitarian. </p>
<p> The point here is <span class="rend-i">not</span> that collectives can't be pushed into
               chaotic basins of attraction that spell their destruction, or, at least, bifurcation,
               down the road, but rather that these strange strangers are not, to put it in
               Aristotelian/Scholastic terms, <span class="rend-i">accidents</span>. Put more precisely,
               these strange strangers are not <span class="rend-i">outside</span> of worlds, but rather
               are themselves elements of worlds. The Luddite thesis that Man, technology, and media
               are unnatural imposters that unbalance the natural order of the World is premised on
               the existence of a World that never existed to begin with. They treat as ontological
               what is, in reality, a covert normative judgment. And again, here the point is not
               that normative judgments shouldn't be made, but that these judgments are made from
               the standpoint of a particular system or object and do not themselves determine what
               is or is not. But more fundamentally, from the standpoint of worlds, the harmonic has
               never existed. It has never been the case that it is merely Man, Technology, or Media
               that perturbs Nature. The odds are that at this very moment, somewhere in the
               universe or the multiverse, there is a massive black hole devouring a solar system
               with a rich and complex ecosystem supporting sentient and intelligent life. The Black
               Plague swept across Europe and Asia for decades and centuries, wiping out massive
               populations of humans and other creatures. Precambrian organisms caused the
               extinction of many of their species by saturating their environment with oxygen,
               diluting the carbon dioxide they needed to thrive. The dinosaurs very likely became
               extinct as a result of an asteroid. It is worlds themselves that are out of kilter
               and lacking in harmony. While we should make the case for certain forms of
               equilibrium, balance, or harmony, we should refuse to ontologize such claims,
               treating them as reflective of a “Goddess Earth”, and be upfront in the declaration
               that these are normative judgments made from the standpoint of a particular object or
               system. From the standpoint of the bubonic plague, sickness is merely a convenient
               way of replicating itself. In other words, it is not sickness at all. </p>
<p> The thesis that the world does not exist is crucial to flat ontology so as to avoid
               surreptitiously treating as collected that which is not collected. What the
               inexistence of the world teaches is that worlds are a work, that meshes must be
               produced, and that they cannot be said to exist in advance. There is, as Graham
               Harman has so aptly, beautifully, and poetically put it in <span class="rend-i">Guerrilla Metaphysics</span>, a “carpentry” of being. That is to say, collectives
               must be built by the objects that deign to enter into structural couplings with one
               another. In this regard, the inexistence of the world draws our attention to what
               Latour has called the “sociology of associations” as opposed to the “sociology of the
                  social”.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_289" id="link_note_289" class="note-footer-link">[289]</a> It seems that if he could, Latour would prefer to abandon the term
               “sociology” altogether given the manner in which it is thoroughly contaminated by
               what he calls “the modernist constitution”, where nature and society are treated as
               two entirely distinct domains. Yet if, contends Latour, the term “sociology” should
               be retained then it ought to be retained not as a theory of that peculiar domain of
               what is <span class="rend-i">unique</span> to the human, but rather as that domain that
               pertains to associations, relations, or what Harman calls “the carpentry of being”.
               Where the sociology of the social appeals to society, social forces, power, meaning,
               language, and a host of other nefarious human-related entities to explain why people
               behave as they do, the sociology of associations instead draws attention to how
               relations are forged in the creation of assemblages. </p>
<p> The profound difference embodied in Latour's sociology of associations is not only
               that it draws attention to relations between humans and nonhumans and how these
               relations are forged and what impact they have, but that we can imagine a sociology
               of associations that does not involve humans at all. This would not simply be a
               matter of analyzing bee, ant, and gorilla societies after the fashion of Jane
               Goodall, but would involve the investigation of collectives involving no sentient
               beings whatsoever. For example, the sociologist of associations might investigate the
               impact various storms and winds have on strata and how they manage to maintain such
               remarkable chaotic consistency. In this regard, the molecular biologist and the
               chemist are sociologists of association, for they investigate how particular
               collectives are forged among particular actors. It just happens that these
               collectives are composed not of humans or animals, but of atoms of oxygen, hydrogen,
               and heavy metals. What is, above all, important to remember for the purposes of flat
               ontology is not simply that the World does not exist, but rather that collectives
               must be forged. Moreover, it must be remembered that not all entities relate to all
               other entities and that like the floating city of George Lucas's <span class="rend-i">Empire Strikes Back</span>, there are collectives that are unassociated with other
               collectives and that know nothing of other collectives. While the thesis that the
               World does not exist or that being does not form an organic harmonious totality might
               appear to be a grim hypothesis, denying us our oneness and unity with everything
               else, this thesis also embodies the freedom and hope of collectives; for it entails
               that we can set about the arduous work of building new collectives and welcoming
               unheard of strange strangers, building what are as of yet unheard of collectives. In
               other words, the theory that the Whole and World do not exist both promises to free
               us from a tyrannical collective gone mad and offers the possibility of building other
               collectives. Rather than critique, which is, in its own way and from its own point of
               view indispensable, the thesis that the world does not exist offers us the activity
               of <span class="rend-i">composition</span>. </p>

<a name="10.3"></a><h3>6.3. Being is Flat </h3>
<p> The foregoing chapters and sections lead to the conclusion that being is flat. The
               flatness of being is embodied in two fundamental claims. First, in light of our
               exploration of the interior of objects in chapter four, it becomes clear that
               ontologically the bland human-world gap or relationship possesses no metaphysical
               priority. As Harman puts it, “object-oriented philosophy holds that the relation of
               humans to pollen, oxygen, eagles, or windmills is no different in kind from the
               interaction of these objects with each other”.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_290" id="link_note_290" class="note-footer-link">[290]</a> Second, onticology and object-oriented philosophy establish what might be
               called a heteroverse or pluriverse, where entities at all levels of scale, whether
               natural or cultural, physical or artificial, material or semiotic are on equal
               ontological footing. As Ian Bogost puts it, “all beings equally exist, <span class="rend-i">yet they do not exist equally</span>”.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_291" id="link_note_291" class="note-footer-link">[291]</a> Onticology and object-oriented philosophy therefore democratizes being,
               asserting not one primary gap between subjects and objects, humans and world, mind
               and reality, but rather an infinity of gaps or vacuums between objects regardless of
               whether humans are involved. Likewise, onticology and object-oriented philosophy
               democratize being by defending a plurality of types of objects, ranging from the
               semiotic to the natural. Rather than treating one type of object such as quantum
               particles as the really real upon which all else is grounded and to which all else
               ultimately reduces, flat ontology advocates a pluralism of types of objects at all
               levels of scale that are irreducible to one another. In other words, objects of
               different types and at different levels of scale are what Aristotle referred to as
               genuine primary substances. </p>
<p> As Harman has compellingly argued, philosophy, for the last two hundred or so years,
               has been obsessed with a single gap between the human and the world, treating this
               gap as metaphysically privileged or special, unlike all other relations with objects.
               Within the framework of onticology and object-oriented philosophy, however, the
               human-object gap possesses no privileged status, but is one among many gaps
               populating a heteroverse. As Harman remarks, </p>
<div class="q1-block"> [w]hen the things withdraw from presence into their dark
               subterranean reality, they distance themselves not only from human beings, but <span class="rend-i">from each other</span> as well. If the human perception of a house or
               tree is forever haunted by some hidden surplus in the things that never become
               present, the same is true of the sheer causal interaction between rocks or
                  raindrops.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_292" id="link_note_292" class="note-footer-link">[292]</a>
</div>
<p> From this Harman concludes that, “contrary to the dominant assumption of philosophy
               since Kant, the true chasm in ontology lies not between humans and world, but between
                  <span class="rend-i">objects and relations</span>”.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_293" id="link_note_293" class="note-footer-link">[293]</a> Far from the gap between humans and objects constituting a unique form of
               relation, withdrawal is a perfectly ubiquitous relation within being characteristic
               of <span class="rend-i">all</span> relations between objects. All objects are strange
               strangers with respect to one another regardless of whether or not humans are
               involved in these relations. Moreover, all objects are strange strangers with respect
               to themselves. </p>
<p> Within the framework of onticology, the ubiquity of withdrawal characteristic of all
               objects is theorized in terms of the operational closure of objects analyzed in
               chapter four and the split within objects between virtual proper being and local
               manifestation analyzed in chapter three. With respect to the operational closure of
               objects, the relation between objects whether human, social, biological, or inanimate
               is a non-relation between objects in which objects never directly touch or encounter
               one another. Like Leibniz's windowless monads, each object is a discrete substance or
               unit of its own, withdrawn from all other objects without any direct relation or
               contact. Objects never directly encounter one another, but rather only relate to one
               another as translations or information. And information is never something
               transmitted or exchanged by objects, but rather is constituted by each object as a
               function of its own internal organization and distinctions. </p>
<p> With respect to the split nature of objects embodied in the split between virtual
               proper being and local manifestation, a similar ubiquity of withdrawal is
               encountered. The virtual proper being of objects is abyssal and subterranean, such
               that it itself never comes to presence. Virtual proper being is structured without
               being qualitative and refers to that domain of powers and attractors presiding over
               the actualization of qualities or local manifestations. Insofar as virtual proper
               being is thoroughly withdrawn and never itself becomes present, it can only be
               inferred through the actual. It is only through tracking local manifestations and
               their variations that we get any sense of the dark volcanic powers harbored within
               objects. In other words, through second-order observation or the observation of how
               an object relates to the world in its non-relation, we form a hypothetical diagram of
               objects or a map of their attractors or powers. However, insofar as all local
               manifestations create something new in the form of qualities, this diagram can only
               ever be partial, hypothetical, and incomplete for, as Spinoza so nicely put it, we
               don't ever completely know what objects can do. </p>
<p> Nor is the withdrawal of objects ever merely a withdrawal of objects with respect to
               one another. Withdrawal is a form of non-relation so thorough that objects aren't
               simply withdrawn from one another, but are withdrawn even from themselves. As we have
               seen, all objects are akin to Lacanian divided subjects, $. On the one hand, no
               object ever actualizes the subterranean volcanic core with which its virtual proper
               being is haunted. This virtual domain is like a reserve or excess that never comes to
               presence. It is not simply that objects are, in themselves, fully actual and only
               withdrawn for other objects relating to them, but rather that objects are withdrawn
               in themselves. On the other hand, the distinctions or organization by which objects
               produce information for themselves are themselves withdrawn or invisible to the
               object that deploys them. As we have seen, every distinction necessarily contains two
               blind spots. Distinctions are blind to the unmarked space produced as a result of the
               distinction. As Luhmann puts it, objects can only see what they can see and cannot
               see what they cannot see. Moreover, they do not see that they do not see this. Yet in
               addition to this, objects are blind to their own operative distinctions. Distinctions
               can only be observed or used, but never observed <span class="rend-i">and</span> used. In
               making indications or interacting with other objects, the distinctions that render
               these indications possible become thoroughly invisible. </p>
<p> Insofar as withdrawal is ubiquitous, there is no reason to treat the human-object
               relation as metaphysically privileged. The human-object relation is not a special
               relation, not a unique relation, but a subset of a far more pervasive ontological
               truth that pertains to objects of all types. The point here is not that we should
               exclude inquiry into human/object relations or social/object relations, but rather
               that these analyses are analyses for regional ontology, for a particular domain of
               being, not privileged grounds of ontology as such. The issue here is thus very
               subtle. It is not a question of excluding the human and the social, but of
               decentering them from the place of ontological privilege they currently enjoy within
               contemporary philosophy and theory. Nor does this entail that all objects relate to
               other objects in exactly the same way. There are as many forms of translation as
               there are types of objects. Indeed, there are as many forms of translation as there
               are objects. Moreover, new forms of translation come into being all the time with the
               emergence of new objects and with the development of objects as analyzed in chapters
               four and five. </p>
<p> What onticology and, I believe, object-oriented philosophy propose is therefore a
               subtle shift in the distinctions governing the marked space of what philosophy and
               theory indicates. Far from seeking to exclude or eradicate phenomenology and bodies
               of cultural theory in the name of, for example, a naturalism or a scientistic
               materialism, object-oriented ontology aims to <span class="rend-i">expand</span> what can
               be indicated within the domain of philosophy and theory. Onticology and
               object-oriented philosophy thus find themselves in the position of receiving opposite
               and opposed objections from all sides. From the culturalists, we receive criticisms
               declaring that we are rejecting the human, the subject, meaning, signs, and the
               social. From the naturalists, we are accused of wooly-headed thinking that treats
               social entities, semiotic entities, texts, films, fictions and so on as real and
               autonomous entities within being. </p>
<p> In both cases, however, the rejoinder of object-oriented ontology is the same. What
               is objected to with respect to the culturalists is not the thesis that humans and
               social entities translate other entities in their own way, nor the thesis that humans
               and social entities are not genuine entities, but rather the Malkovichism that arises
               from privileging the human/world or social/world gap. As we saw in 6.1, Malkovichism
               consists in treating all other objects as blank screens upon which humans project
               their meanings, intentions, signs, and signifiers. Malkovich, like Narcissus, sees
               only himself in other objects, denying objects their own autonomy and dignity. The
               trick of cultural analysis thus lies in demonstrating that what we take to be the
               object is rather our own alienated image. What object-oriented ontology opposes is
               not the thesis that humans and society translate other objects, nor the thesis that
               humans and societies only encounter objects in “distorted” form in their own
               interior, but rather the culturalist tendency to reduce objects to alienated human
               reflections. To be sure we can, and should, investigate the manner in which humans
               and societies translate objects. Put in more technical terms, we should engage in
               reflexive second-order observations of our own distinctions and how they organize our
               experience of the world. Yet having made this concession, we must also redraw our
               distinctions in such a way as to make room for nonhuman objects as autonomous actors
               in their own right, such that these objects are not treated as merely passive screens
               for human projections and such that they are treated as perturbing the world in their
               own way. In other words, the point is to expand the domain of what can be
               investigated, not to limit it. However, this requires placing objects in the marked
               space of our distinctions and treating humans and societies as entities <span class="rend-i">among</span> other entities. </p>
<p> From the naturalists, by contrast, object-oriented ontologists are accused of
               treating a variety of psychic and cultural entities as real entities, ignoring the
               truth that the only real reality is the material and physical world. Put crudely, the
               naturalist accuses object-oriented ontology of treating as real what is merely an
               illusion or derivative. To the ears of the naturalist, object-oriented ontology thus
               looks like a form of arch-culturalism insofar as it treats entities like nations,
               groups, chairs, films, and so on as genuinely real entities. To make matters worse,
               the naturalist is appalled by the object-oriented thesis that these entities are
               irreducible to the physical, material, or natural domain. This ends up getting
               translated into the thesis that object-oriented ontology rejects neurology, biology,
               chemistry, physics and a host of other “hard sciences”. </p>
<p> However, once again, the point is the same. The aim is not to exclude or reject the
               entities explored by the “hard sciences”, but to refuse a hierarchical conception of
               being where these entities are treated as the “really real” beings and all the others
               are treated as derivative illusions or mere effects. Here, again, the aim is not to
               limit inquiry, but to expand the domain of what can be investigated. With the
               naturalists, object-oriented ontology agrees that the culturalists or social
               constructivists have illicitly reduced nonhuman beings to cultural constructs. With
               the social constructivists or culturalists, however, object-oriented ontology refuses
               to treat social and cultural entities as mere effects of the material and physical.
               Rather, object-oriented ontology argues that these entities are genuinely real
               entities in their own right. What object-oriented ontology thus objects to is the
               reductivism of many naturalist approaches. </p>
<p> However here we must proceed with care. Object-oriented ontology can readily agree
               that Supreme Court justices are impossible without brains, even if often it appears
               that they don't use their brains. The point is that brains are one thing and Supreme
               Court justices are another thing. Being a Supreme Court justice is irreducible to
               being a brain. Here we encounter considerations of both mereology and operational
               closure. In a rather bizarre formulation, we can ask ourselves whether <span class="rend-i">Antonin Scalia</span> is a Supreme Court justice. Initially the answer
               would appear to be an obvious yes, unless, somehow, Scalia is an imposter. However,
               within the framework of onticology, matters are not so simple. Supreme Court justices
               are elements within a particular object, namely, the United States. Like all other
               objects, this object is operationally closed, relating only to itself. As such,
               Scalia, the individual psychic system, belongs not to that object that contains
               Justice Scalia as an element, but rather to the <span class="rend-i">environment</span> of
               that object. Put differently, Scalia the individual psychic system belongs to the
               environment of Justice Scalia the element within a particular larger scale object.
               Moreover, insofar as the individual psychic system Scalia is itself an operationally
               closed object, it follows that Scalia's brain belongs to the <span class="rend-i">environment</span> of Scalia the individual psychic system. Insofar as Scalia's
               brain, such as it is, belongs to the environment of the individual psychic system
               Scalia, and insofar as Scalia belongs to the environment of that object that contains
               Justice Scalia as a member, it follows that Scalia's brain can only perturb Scalia
               the individual psychic system, and that Scalia the psychic system can only perturb
               the social-system or object that contains Justice Scalia as an element. In other
               words, each of these objects is withdrawn from the other such that each operates in
               terms of its own operational closure translating perturbations from one another into
               information. </p>
<p> In this regard, Scalia's brain has little to tell us about Justice Scalia. Put
               differently, Justice Scalia is irreducible to the individual psychic system Scalia,
               and the individual psychic system Scalia is irreducible to Scalia's brain. Instead,
               what we get is something akin to a high voltage Jacob's Ladder where sparks leap from
               non-communicating object to non-communicating object with each of these objects being
               irreducible to one another. At this point, I imagine the naturalist protesting that
               I'm proposing a thoroughly obscurantist universe populated by all sorts of occult
               substances like so many ghosts. Am I not here suggesting that Scalia is an immaterial
               soul and, were it not problematic enough to posit immaterial souls for individuals,
               have I not now multiplied the sorts of souls that exist through the postulation of
               even stranger objects like groups, societies, roles, and so on? Is not Ockham
               spinning in his grave in response to my lack of ontological parsimony? </p>
<p> However, I have already developed the resources for responding to this criticism in
               section 5.3 where I addressed the ontology of structure. While emergent entities are
               indeed irreducible to smaller scale entities, this does not entail that they violate
               any laws of physics or material reality. As we saw in 5.3, the defining feature of
               structure lies in the manner in which relations among elements making up the
               endo-structure of an entity or system are constrained. Nothing about these
               constraints violates the laws of physics or the findings of neurology, however the
               laws of physics and the findings of neurology cannot themselves account for why
               relations among elements are constrained or structured in this particular way. It is
               this nature of constraints or structures that accounts for the irreducibility of
               larger-scale objects. In a fine discussion of causality and emergence, Protevi
               writes, </p>
<div class="q1-block"> [t]he concept of emergence entails reciprocal or circular
               causality. Upward causality is the emergence of systematic focused capacities (the
               parts of a system function in such a way as to provide for capacities of the system
               that the individual parts do not possess), and downward causality is the constraint
               on the behavior of component parts that enables systematic-capacities (the whole
               exerts an influence on the parts that now have a reduced field of action).<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_294" id="link_note_294" class="note-footer-link">[294]</a>
</div>
<p> With emergence, higher scale objects take on a life of their own that can only be
               accounted for in terms of their own organization. Such objects begin to constitute
               their own elements through their own elements. Here upward causality refers to the
               manner in which elements of the object produce the object, whereas downward causality
               refers to the manner in which the object constrains and structures its elements. What
               we get here is a system-specific causality, unique to each object, that while
               dependent on lower-scale objects is not accounted for by these objects. </p>
<p> With these observations, we now encounter the heteroverse characteristic of the flat
               ontology advocated by onticology and object-oriented ontology. Rather than one type
               of object, such as subatomic particles, that constitutes the really real, we instead
               get a heteroverse of different types of autonomous and irreducible objects ranging
               from quarks to tardigrades to ecosystems, groups, institutions, societies, humans,
               burritos and so on. An awl is no less real than a cane toad by virtue of being
               fabricated by humans, nor is an institution or group any less real than an awl by
               virtue of being immaterial. It might be argued that an awl is only an awl so long as
               it exists within the framework of society. Perhaps this is true, but how is this any
               different from the other regimes of attraction we explore in 5.1 where we saw that
               the particular form a local manifestation takes is in part dependent on structural
               couplings and regimes of attraction? When a sadistic scientist places a cane toad
               within a glass box without oxygen, that cane toad very quickly loses the capacity to
               locally manifest qualities pertaining to life. When the awl is detached from society,
               it is no longer able to locally manifest powers of punching holes in wood or leather.
               In these instances, what has been abolished is not the entity itself, but rather the
               ability of the entity to locally manifest itself in a particular way. Of course, in
               the case of the frog, entropy begins to set in rather quickly. Then again, it appears
               that this particular limitation on local manifestations arising from the absence of
               particular structural couplings is not necessarily irreversible in that it appears
               there are many instances where frogs can be brought back to life. </p>
<p> With this heteroverse of varied objects, we begin to see just how much the concept
               of society and the concept of collectives discussed in 6.2 differ from one another.
               The distinctions organizing the concept of society draw attention to subjectivity,
               signs, meanings, narratives, texts, discourses, power, social forces and so on. By
               contrast, the concept of collectives draws our attention to a variety of very
               different actors, human and nonhuman, perturbing and translating each other in
               particular ways within networks or assemblages. No doubt, it is something like this
               that Guattari was after in <span class="rend-i">Chaosmosis</span>. As Guattari writes, </p>
<div class="q1-block"> [s]hould we keep the semiotic productions of the mass media,
               informatics, telematics and robotics separate from psychological subjectivity? I
               don't think so. Just as social machines can be grouped under the general title of
               Collective Equipment, technological machines of information and communication operate
               at the heart of human subjectivity, not only within its memory and intelligence, but
               within its sensibility, affects and unconscious fantasms. Recognition of these
               machinic dimensions of subjectivation leads us to insist, in our attempt at
               redefinition, on the heterogeneity of the components leading to the production of
               subjectivity. Thus one finds in it: 1. Signifying semiological components which
               appear in the family, education, the environment, religion, art, sport [...]. 2.
               Elements constructed by the media industry, the cinema, etc., 3. A-signifying
               semiological dimensions that trigger informational sign machines, and that function
               in parallel or independent of the fact that they produce and convey significations
               and denotations, and thus escape from strictly linguistic axiomatics.<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/ohp/9750134.0001.001/1:10/--democracy-of-objects?rgn=div1;view=fulltext#note_295" id="link_note_295" class="note-footer-link">[295]</a>

<p> Guattari appears to envision the analysis of collectives where a variety of
               different actors or objects ranging from subjects to signs to technologies and groups
               and institutions interact with one another in a highly complex fashion. To Guattari's
               list, of course, we could add the presence or absence of roads, power lines, internet
               connections, weather patterns, cane toads, ocean-going ships and canoes, H1N1 viruses
               and a host of other objects. Guattari's ontology is flat in the precise sense that
               all of these entities are full-blown actors rather than mere screens for human signs
               and intentions. And, of course, collectives need not involve signs or humans at all,
               but can be purely inhuman as in the case of the atmosphere of Saturn. </p>
<p> At this point, it is not unusual to hear humanist correlationists cry foul, accusing
               object-oriented ontologists of technological and environmental determinism. In my
               view, this is an unfair criticism. Somehow pointing out that it is impossible to fry
               eggs without a frying pan or some similar cooking surface becomes equivalent to the
               thesis that frying pans determine people to fry eggs. Somehow pointing out how the
               inland remoteness of China's abundant coal reserves played a role in China not
               kicking off the industrial revolution is transformed into the claim that this
               remoteness determined the form that Chinese culture took. In this regard, any
               qualification of human freedom, any evocation of actors other than meaning,
               narratives, signifiers, and discourses is responded to with incredulity at the
               suggestion that humans are merely among other beings rather than at the center of
               beings such that nonhuman beings are merely their screen, passive things upon which
               they impose form through their intentions and techniques, and where the world is
               merely our own alienated reflection. Such is the height of Malkovichism. </p>
<p> Faced with decades of content-based cultural criticism that implicitly, at least,
               adheres to Marx's formula that the aim of philosophy is not to represent the world,
               but rather to change it, it is peculiar that such theory doesn't seem to recognize
               that such cultural critiques seem to be fairly unsuccessful in producing their
               desired change. Here one would think that social and political theorists would become
               aware that this absence of change suggests that perhaps meanings, signifiers, signs,
               narratives, and discourses are not the entire story. One would think that <span class="rend-i">in addition</span> to these semiotic actors that play a role in
               collectives of humans and nonhumans, greater attention would be directed at the role
               of nonhuman actors in human collectives and the role they play in constraining the
               possibilities of existence. Such an attentiveness to these nonhuman actors would
               provide us with the resources for thinking strategies of composition that might push
               collectives into new basins of attraction. Whether or not a village has a well, a
               city has roads that provide access to other cities, and whether people have
               alternative forms of occupation and transportation can play a dramatic role in the
               form collectives take. However, in much of contemporary cultural theory, these sorts
               of actors are almost entirely invisible because the marked space of theory revolves
               around the semiotic, placing nonhuman actors in the unmarked space of thought and
               social engagement. </p>
<p> However, setting aside these criticisms, the more basic ontological point is that
               there can be no question of technological or environmental determinism precisely
               because objects cannot be determined by other objects. Insofar as all objects are
               withdrawn from one another, insofar as objects only relate to their environment
               selectively and through their own distinctions or organization, there can be no
               question of objects determining one another. This holds for humans as well. The most
               one object can do to another is perturb it, and even this is not always the case as
               objects are only selectively related to their environment such that there are many
               things towards which they are completely blind. In this regard, the manner in which
               one object responds to another always embodies a high degree of creativity. </p>
<p> In many respects, all of onticology culminates in the four theses of flat ontology.
               It is flat ontology that constitutes the democracy of objects. However, this
               democracy of objects does not amount to the thesis that all objects contribute
               equally to all other objects or to all collectives. Clearly tardigrades contribute
               little or nothing to collectives involving human beings. Here, then, I return to Ian
               Bogost's thesis that all objects equally exist, but not all objects exist equally.
               Entities perturb other objects more and less. Entities play greater and smaller roles
               in various collectives. Some entities, no doubt, do not perturb other objects at all,
               and as we saw in the case of Roy Bhasker in the first chapter, other objects are
               dormant. Flat ontology is not the thesis that all objects contribute equally, but
               that all objects equally exist. In its ontological egalitarianism, what flat ontology
               thus refuses is the erasure of any object as the mere construction of another object. </p>
